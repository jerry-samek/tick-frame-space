# **Foundational Dynamics of the Gradient‑Hill Universe**
### *Formalized Model Specification (v0.1)*

## **1. Entities**
Entities are autonomous processes that exist within a dynamic gradient field (“the hill”).  
Each entity is defined by:

- **Imprint** — its historical trace of actions and corrections.
- **Window** — the finite segment of its imprint accessible at any tick.
- **Baseline Height** — the height at which the entity was created.
- **Current Height** — the height after the global recomputation of the hill.
- **Correction Alphabet** — a minimal 3‑symbol action set:
    - **1 = reinforce** (positive correction)
    - **–1 = reverse** (negative correction)
    - **0 = continue** (neutral persistence)

Entities do not possess meta‑awareness of limits; they only perceive relative changes in height.

---

## **2. The Hill (Global Gradient Field)**
The hill is a dynamic scalar field generated by the combined imprint of all entities.

### **2.1 Properties**
- The hill **recomputes every tick** from all committed imprints.
- The hill **naturally sinks** over time (global decay).
- The hill has a **stable slope region** and a **critical curvature region** near the peak.
- Entities must continuously compensate for the sinking hill to maintain height.

### **2.2 Height Interpretation**
- **Higher height = lower cost of existence**
- **Lower height = higher cost of corrections**
- **Critical height** marks the transition where passive energy is insufficient.

---

## **3. Imprint and Window Mechanics**
### **3.1 Imprint**
An imprint is the full historical sequence of corrections (1, –1, 0).

### **3.2 Window**
- Each entity has a **fixed-size window** into its imprint.
- The window grows only when a **new entity is created** (because the global tick‑space has expanded).
- The oldest tick is discarded when the window overflows (FIFO).

### **3.3 Commit**
At each tick, the entity commits its current imprint window to the global hill.  
This commit contributes to the next global recomputation.

---

## **4. Stability and Navigation**
Entities navigate the hill using only their correction alphabet and the relative change in height.

### **4.1 Height Delta**
\[
\Delta H = H_{\text{current}} - H_{\text{baseline}}
\]

### **4.2 Height Acceleration**
\[
\Delta\Delta H = \Delta H_{\text{current}} - \Delta H_{\text{previous}}
\]

### **4.3 Interpretation**
- **ΔH > 0** → entity is improving (successful navigation)
- **ΔH ≈ 0** → entity is maintaining (neutral stability)
- **ΔH < 0** → entity is degrading (falling behind hill decay)
- **ΔΔH < 0** → degradation is accelerating (critical instability)

---

## **5. Correction Logic**
Entities choose actions based on ΔH:

| Condition | Action |
|----------|--------|
| ΔH > 0 | reinforce (1) |
| ΔH ≈ 0 | continue (0) |
| ΔH < 0 | reverse (–1) |
| ΔH << 0 | large correction (multiple –1 or reorientation) |
| ΔΔH < 0 | replication trigger |

Entities do not know why these rules work; they only react to height changes.

---

## **6. Replication**
Replication is the mechanism by which an entity resets its window capacity.

### **6.1 Trigger**
Replication occurs when:

- **|ΔH| exceeds a critical threshold**, or
- **ΔΔH is negative**, indicating accelerating collapse.

### **6.2 Effect**
A new entity is created:

- at the current tick (thus with a **larger window**),
- inheriting the parent’s baseline height,
- but with a fresh imprint.

Replication is not reproduction; it is **survival through renewal**.

---

## **7. Passive vs. Active Energy**
### **7.1 Passive Energy (“slide energy”)**
Energy gained from moving along the stable slope of the hill.

- Sufficient for maintaining existence in the lower/middle regions.
- Insufficient for climbing toward the peak.

### **7.2 Active Energy**
Required to climb into the upper curvature region.

Active energy must come from:

- **transforming other processes**,
- **merging imprints**,
- **absorbing local collapses**,
- or **leveraging interactions**.

This is the basis of metabolism.

---

## **8. Inter‑Process Interactions**
### **8.1 Merges**
When two imprints overlap in compatible geometry, energy transfer becomes possible.

This may occur:

- spontaneously (emergent),
- or as a deterministic consequence of imprint alignment.

### **8.2 Rings (Encirclement Instability)**
If surrounding entities form a ring:

- the central region loses support,
- the hill collapses inward,
- the central entity falls rapidly (ΔH << 0),
- triggering forced replication or destruction.

This is the primary collapse mechanism.

---

## **9. Primordial Entities**
Some entities begin at high altitude due to initial conditions.

Properties:

- require minimal correction,
- have low existence cost,
- define the geometry of the peak,
- act as “energetic aristocracy”.

These correspond to stable early‑universe particles (e.g., hydrogen analogues).

---

## **10. Evolutionary Pressure**
Entities must:

1. Maintain height against hill decay.
2. Expand stable area without overcrowding.
3. Avoid ring formation.
4. Acquire active energy to climb.
5. Replicate before window degradation prevents navigation.

This produces natural selection among processes.
