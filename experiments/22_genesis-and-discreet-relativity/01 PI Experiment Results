# Pi Experiment Results
### *Scale‑Dependent Reconstruction of π in a Discrete Substrate*

---

## 1. Purpose

This experiment measures how accurately an observer can reconstruct the value of π from a discrete substrate using adjacency shells and Euclidean distance reconstruction. Radii span 92 orders of magnitude (R = 1 to R = 10⁹²), using only 1000 discrete points arranged on a circle.

The goal is to understand how π emerges from discrete adjacency and how its accuracy changes with scale.

## 2. Core Finding

**π is not a substrate constant.
π is an emergent observer quantity whose accuracy depends on scale.**

Measured values drift from **2.828** at R = 1 to **3.141587486** at R = 10⁹².
This drift reflects geometric emergence, not a change in π itself.

## 3. Geometric Regimes

The experiment reveals three distinct geometric phases:

---

### 3.1 Quantum Regime (R = 1–100) — *Discrete Geometry Dominant*

- π ≈ **2.828** at R = 1 (≈ 10% error)
- Shells are irregular and dimensionally ambiguous
- Geometry behaves like a quantized lattice
- Effective space is non‑Euclidean
- π is not well‑defined at this scale

This corresponds to a Planck‑like regime where discreteness overwhelms geometry.

---

### 3.2 Classical Regime (R = 10²–10¹⁰) — *Emergent Euclidean Geometry*

- π converges rapidly toward 3.14159
- Error < **0.001%** across most of this range
- Shell growth becomes smooth and radial
- Euclidean geometry emerges from adjacency
- Best measurement: π ≈ **3.141582…** at R = 10²²

This is the regime where classical physics operates.

---

### 3.3 Cosmological Regime (R > 10¹⁰) — *Stable Geometry at Extreme Scale*

- π remains stable up to R = 10⁹²
- Error stays < **0.001%**
- Sparse sampling remains sufficient
- Geometry persists despite extreme scale

This corresponds to universe‑scale reconstruction.

## 4. Interpretation of Pi Drift

The drift from π ≈ 2.828 → 3.141587 is not a physical change in π.
It represents a **geometric phase transition**:

1. **Discrete adjacency** dominates at small scales
2. **Continuous geometry** emerges at intermediate scales
3. **Cosmological stability** appears at extreme scales

Key insights:

- π is not encoded in the substrate
- π is reconstructed by the observer
- Geometry is scale‑dependent
- Continuum physics is an approximation
- Constants are operational, not absolute

A constant is defined as:

> A quantity whose scale‑dependent drift is smaller than the universe’s experimental bandwidth.

## 5. Implications for the Tick‑Frame Universe

### 5.1 Geometry is Emergent
The substrate contains no geometry.
Observers reconstruct geometry from adjacency and scale.

### 5.2 Constants Are Emergent
π is not fundamental; it is an emergent, scale‑dependent quantity.

### 5.3 Discreteness Matters
At small scales, geometry collapses into lattice behavior.

### 5.4 Continuum Physics Is Approximate
Euclidean geometry emerges only in the classical regime.

### 5.5 Cosmological Stability
Even sparse sampling preserves geometry at extreme scales.

## 6. Final Conclusion

Across 92 orders of magnitude, the π experiment demonstrates:

- Geometry is not absolute
- π is not fundamental
- Continuum behavior emerges from discrete adjacency
- Observers reconstruct geometry with scale‑dependent accuracy
- π becomes “constant” only when discreteness noise is negligible

Even if π drifts at universe‑scale radii, no internal observer can measure a circle that large, making the drift physically irrelevant.

This experiment provides a concrete, numerical demonstration of emergent geometry in a discrete substrate.
