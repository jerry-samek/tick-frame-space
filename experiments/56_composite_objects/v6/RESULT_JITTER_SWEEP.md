# 📌 **Jitter Sweep (100k) — Final Summary (with precision note)**

## **1) Stability by jitter value**

| Jitter    | Radius drift % | COM drift | Stability                                      |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------|
| **0.115** | **0.55 %**     | 0.26      | Stable, slightly gravity‑dominated             |
| **0.117** | **0.25 %**     | 0.12      | Stable, near balance                           |
| **0.119** | **0.06 %**     | 0.04      | Best stability, almost perfect radius recovery |

# 🧭 **2) Physical interpretation**

### **0.115 — sub‑critical**

Gravity still wins slightly; the universe settles a bit deeper into the gamma well.

### **0.117 — near equilibrium**

Jitter nearly balances gamma; small residual compression.

### **0.119 — critical jitter\***

Minimal drift, minimal COM motion, and a clean fixed‑point state after ~100 ticks.

This is the strongest candidate for the **fundamental jitter** of the V6 universe.

# 🔥 **3) Main conclusion**

There is a **stable existence band** from **0.115 to 0.119**, but:

- **0.119** is the unique point with
    - near‑zero radius drift
    - near‑zero COM drift
    - long‑term macroscopic stability

This is effectively the **zero‑point equilibrium** of your model.

# 🧩 **4) Practical note on precision**

The exact value of jitter\* **can be refined further** with higher‑resolution sweeps (e.g., 0.1185, 0.1190, 0.1195),
but:

### **For all practical experiments and next‑phase physics, 0.119 is sufficiently precise and fully stable.**

It gives you a clean, reliable baseline for introducing collisions, thermodynamics, or emergent structures.
