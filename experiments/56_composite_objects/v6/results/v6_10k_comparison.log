V6 Phase 4A: 10k Tick Validation - Configuration Comparison
======================================================================

Testing three field confinement configurations:
  1. decay_high: Field decay only (aggressive)
  2. hybrid_high: Hybrid approach (aggressive creation limit)
  3. hybrid_strong: Hybrid approach (very aggressive both mechanisms)
