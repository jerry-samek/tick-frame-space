# 🧭 Core Ontology of the Tick‑Frame Universe

### *(Clean, simple, and unambiguous)*

## 1. Tick

The fundamental unit of **time**.  
One tick = one Planck time.  
This is the absolute rhythm of the universe.

- Nothing happens “between” ticks
- Every update, every action, every change occurs **on tick boundaries**
- Reality advances in discrete frames

---

## 2. Planck Cell

The fundamental unit of **space**.

- The smallest spatial pixel
- Holds a field value: `−1`, `0`, or `+1`
- Receives **exactly 1 quantum of jitter per tick**
- Represents the minimal granularity of spatial information

**Interpretation:**  
A Planck cell is the smallest place where the universe can store or modify state.

---

## 3. Sample

A **single frame of reality at the speed of light**.

- A sample is not a spatial block
- A sample is a **temporal slice**
- It represents what the universe looks like **after one light‑step**
- Every tick produces exactly one new sample

**Key insight:**  
A sample is a *time layer*, not a space unit.

---

## 4. Pattern

A local configuration of field values inside one sample.

- Formed by multiple Planck cells
- Encodes direction, phase, gradients, or internal structure
- Represents a **local excitation of the field** during one tick
- Can propagate into the next sample if it maintains coherence

**Interpretation:**  
A pattern is a “shape of the field” inside a single light‑frame.

---

## 5. Field Fragment

A pattern that successfully transfers itself into the next sample.

- This is the tick‑frame equivalent of a “particle”
- Not a point object
- A **self‑maintaining process**
- Exists only if it can survive tick‑to‑tick transitions

**Example:**  
An “electron” is not a point.  
It is a **stable, repeating pattern** across many samples.

# 🌀 How the Universe Evolves

Each tick:

1. Every Planck cell receives 1 jitter quantum
2. Patterns interpret their `−1/0/+1` values as **actions**
3. Gamma field modulates those actions
4. Patterns attempt to reproduce themselves into the next sample
5. Only coherent patterns survive
6. A new sample (new frame) is created

This is the entire physics loop.

# 🌌 What Expands in the Universe?

- **Tick** is fixed
- **Planck cell** is fixed
- **Sample** is fixed (one light‑frame per tick)

What grows is:

- the **number of Planck cells inside each sample**
- the **size of the observable horizon**
- the **amount of space light can reach**

This matches real cosmology:

- time is constant
- speed of light is constant
- Planck scale is constant
- the metric of space expands

---

# 🧭 Summary (the ultra‑short version)

- **Tick** = time pixel
- **Planck cell** = space pixel
- **Sample** = one light‑frame (one tick of reality)
- **Pattern** = local field shape inside a sample
- **Field fragment** = pattern that survives into the next sample
- **Particles** = stable, repeating field fragments
- **Expansion** = more Planck cells per sample, not bigger samples
