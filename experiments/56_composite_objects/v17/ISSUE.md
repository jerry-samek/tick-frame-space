# RAW‑083 — Composite Processes and the Unified Imprint Principle
### *Why Composite Objects Cannot Be Modeled as Collections of Entities*
**Status:** VALIDATED (conceptual)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Author:** T.S.  
**Depends on:** RAW‑049 (Temporal Ontology), RAW‑081 (Photon as Degenerate Process), RAW‑082 (Gamma‑Wake Gravity Principle)

## 1. Purpose

This document formalizes the correct ontological treatment of **composite objects** in the tick‑frame / gamma‑field universe.  
It explains why composite objects **cannot** be modeled as collections of independent entities, and why such models inevitably fail.

Instead, a composite object must be represented as:

- **one process**
- **one imprint**
- **one wake**
- **one tick‑budget**
- **one expansion‑resistance profile**

with internal structure encoded as **internal states**, not as sub‑entities.

## 2. The Problem With Multi‑Entity Composites

Attempts to model a composite object as:
[entity A] + [entity B] + [entity C]

fail because each entity:

- has its own imprint
- has its own wake
- has its own drift under expansion
- has its own tick‑budget
- has its own lag accumulation
- has its own resistance to expansion

This leads to:

- desynchronization
- structural breakup
- divergent drift
- wake interference
- instability under expansion
- inconsistent gravitational behavior

These failures are **not implementation bugs**.  
They are **ontological contradictions**.

## 3. The Unified Imprint Principle

### **Statement**

> A composite object must have a **single imprint** in the gamma field.  
> Its internal structure must be represented as **internal states**, not as independent entities.

This follows from the nature of imprint‑economy:

- one imprint → one wake
- one wake → one cost gradient
- one cost gradient → one gravitational behavior
- one tick‑budget → one expansion‑resistance profile

A composite object is therefore **one process**, not a collection of processes.

## 4. Why Multi‑Imprint Composites Fail

### 4.1 Different Drift Rates
Each sub‑entity experiences expansion differently.  
They drift apart.

### 4.2 Different Tick Budgets
Some sub‑entities exhaust their budget sooner.  
Others survive longer.  
The composite disintegrates.

### 4.3 Wake Interference
Multiple wakes overlap and destabilize each other.  
No stable geometry emerges.

### 4.4 No Shared Resistance
Each sub‑entity resists expansion independently.  
There is no unified structural cohesion.

### 4.5 No Shared Cost Landscape
Each sub‑entity follows its own cost gradient.  
The composite cannot maintain shape.

## 5. Correct Model: CompositeEntity Process

A composite object must be represented as:

### **One process with internal structure.**

Formally:
CompositeEntity: imprint: I wake: W tick_budget: T internal_state: - substate_1 - substate_2 - ...

Where:

- `imprint` is a single gamma‑field deformation
- `wake` is the unified gamma‑wake
- `tick_budget` is the total computational capacity
- `internal_state` encodes all “parts” of the object

### **Sub‑states are not entities.**
They do not have:

- their own imprint
- their own wake
- their own drift
- their own tick‑budget

They are **patterns inside the composite process**.

## 6. Consequences

### 6.1 Stability
A composite object becomes stable because:

- one imprint
- one wake
- one drift
- one gravitational behavior
- one expansion‑resistance profile

### 6.2 Gravity
The composite object generates **one gamma‑wake**, producing:

- correct gravitational behavior
- correct cost‑gradient geometry
- correct orbital dynamics

### 6.3 Internal Dynamics
Internal “parts” interact through:

- internal state transitions
- not through independent entity physics

### 6.4 Emergent Complexity
Complex structures (molecules, organisms, machines) become:

- single processes
- with multi‑layered internal state
- not collections of drifting sub‑entities

---

## 7. Summary

Composite objects cannot be modeled as collections of independent entities.  
Such models violate the imprint‑economy and fail under expansion.

A composite object must be:

- **one process**
- **one imprint**
- **one wake**
- **one tick‑budget**
- **one gravitational profile**
- with **internal structure encoded as internal states**

This unifies:

- gravitational behavior
- stability
- internal dynamics
- expansion resistance
- imprint cost optimization

into a single coherent framework.
