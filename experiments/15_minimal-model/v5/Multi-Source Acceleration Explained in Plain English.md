# Multi-Source Acceleration Explained in Plain Language

## 1. The Core Idea
Adding more sources makes the system **see time faster**.  
With one source, the agent has to wait longer before enough energy builds up to cross the perceptual threshold.  
With two or more sources, the field energizes quickly, so commits (the "ticks of time") start earlier and happen more often.

## 2. Everyday Analogy
Think of it like **lighting a room**:

- **One lamp**:  
  You switch it on, but it takes time for the light to spread and brighten the whole room.  
  At first, it feels dim and slow.

- **Two or more lamps**:  
  The room lights up almost instantly.  
  You don’t need to wait for brightness to build — the combined light makes everything visible right away.

In the model, sources act like lamps. More lamps don’t make the room infinitely brighter, but they make it bright **fast**.

## 3. What the Experiments Showed
- **Single source (Mₛ=1):**  
  Needs stronger emissions (α₀≈2.0) or longer observation time (T≥200s) before commits appear.

- **Multiple sources (Mₛ≥2):**  
  Threshold collapses to α₀≈1.0 immediately, even at short horizons.  
  Commits start earlier (first commit time drops from ~129s to ~56s as sources increase).  
  Commit rate rises (more commits per second).

## 4. Key Takeaway
- **One source + short horizon:** slow, restrictive — time feels sluggish.  
- **Multiple sources OR long horizon:** fast, fundamental limit — time feels accelerated.  
- **More sources don’t lower the threshold further, but they speed up the visualization process.**

## 5. Simple Summary
> More sources act like a shortcut for time.  
> They don’t change the minimum threshold beyond the jump, but they make the system perceive events faster — like turning on extra lamps to brighten a room instantly.
