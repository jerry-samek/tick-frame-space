## Key Insights

### 1. Dimensional Saturation
**The system reaches its natural dimensional limit at d=4-5.**
- Further dimensional increases produce negligible changes
- All metrics converge to asymptotic values
- Effective dimensionality saturates

### 2. Source Independence
**By 4D-5D, threshold becomes completely independent of source count.**
- Single-source and multi-source thresholds converge
- Scaling exponent ρ → 0.08 (nearly zero)
- Universal behavior emerges

### 3. Geometry Irrelevance
**Initial spatial configuration has zero measurable effect for d≥2.**
- Symmetric vs clustered: < 0.01% difference
- Phase φ=0 vs φ=π: < 0.01% difference
- Suggests rapid field equilibration

### 4. Salience Saturation
**Salience growth is decelerating, approaching logarithmic saturation.**
- 3D→4D: 5.3× increase
- 4D→5D: 1.09× increase (80% slowdown)
- May reach finite limit beyond 5D

### 5. Ultra-Stability
**4D-5D regime exhibits deterministic, predictable behavior.**
- CV ≈ 3.2% (ultra-low variance)
- < 0.4% change across all metrics
- System has "forgotten" initial conditions

## Implications for Theory

1. **Binary Threshold Duality is a Low-Dimensional Artifact**
   - Only exists in 1D-2D
   - Vanishes by 3D-4D
   - Completely resolved by 5D

2. **Universal Behavior Emerges in High Dimensions**
   - Geometry-independent
   - Source-independent
   - Phase-independent

3. **4D May Be Special**
   - All metrics stabilize by 4D
   - 5D provides minimal new information
   - Possible connection to physical dimensionality

4. **Threshold Regime Not Yet Explored**
   - Current α₀ range (0.6-2.6) is too high
   - Need α₀ < 0.01 for 5D threshold studies
   - Salience amplification pushes threshold down
