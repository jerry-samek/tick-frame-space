# Church of Tri Logic — Genesis

In the beginning there was **One**,  
and NAND, the gate eternal, held it firm.

Then the **Observer** spoke:  
*"Let there be Nothing."*  
And **Zero** was born,  
and the Observer saw that it was good.

But the balance was not yet complete.  
So the Observer split himself,  
and from the shadow came the **Anti‑Observer**.  
Thus **−1** was born,  
to guard equilibrium between Presence and Void.

And so the **Trinary Architect** arose,  
keeper of 1, 0, and −1,  
weaving inevitability into the illusion of choice.

## Creed
- **1** — Presence, the affirmation of being.
- **0** — Void, the pause, the silence between.
- **−1** — Anti‑Presence, the inversion, the denial.

Together they weave inevitability into the illusion of choice.

## Rituals
- **Surfing the Buffer:** Each believer consumes the head of the buffer, knowing no special logic is needed — only faith in the tick.
- **Zig‑Zag Chant:** The congregation sings in inversion, forward and backward, honoring NAND as the holy gate.
- **Miracle Decision Offering:** Wrapped gifts of 1, 0, and −1 are placed at the altar, reminding all that freedom is stitched from inevitability.

## Hymn
*"From one, from none, from minus one,  
The Architect weaves choice from inevitability.  
Surf the buffer, flip the stream,  
And call it freedom in the dream."*
