# Dual Compatibility Principle: Velocity and Density/Curvature

## 1. Statement
> The tick–refresh model is compatible with relativity in two domains:  
> **(a)** velocity boosts (special relativity) and  
> **(b)** density/curvature effects (general relativity).  
> In both cases, demands on refresh stability increase, mirroring relativistic time dilation.

## 2. Root Invariants
- **Planck tick** \(t_P\) remains constant:
  \[
  t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}}
  \]
- **Invariant speed of information transfer:** \(c\) is preserved as the maximum framerate.

---

## 3. Effective Tick Interval
- General form:
  \[
  t_{\text{eff}}(x,v,\rho,\mathcal{K}) = \frac{t_P}{F(x,v,\rho,\mathcal{K})}
  \]
- Frame time:
  \[
  R_n = N_n \cdot t_{\text{eff}}(x,v,\rho,\mathcal{K})
  \]

---

## 4. Velocity Modulation (Special Relativity)
- Define velocity factor:
  \[
  \Xi(v) = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
  \]
- Modulation:
  \[
  F(x,v) = F_0(x) \cdot \Xi(v)
  \]
- As \(v \to c\), \(\Xi(v) \to 0\), so \(t_{\text{eff}} \to \infty\).  
  → More ticks or stronger gating are required to maintain coherence.

---

## 5. Density/Curvature Modulation (General Relativity)
- Einstein field equations relate curvature to energy density:
  \[
  G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}
  \]
- Local density/curvature increases time dilation.  
- Define curvature factor:
  \[
  \Omega(\rho,\mathcal{K}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}}
  \]
- Modulation:
  \[
  F(x,\rho,\mathcal{K}) = F_0(x) \cdot \Omega(\rho,\mathcal{K})
  \]
- As density/curvature grows, \(\Omega \uparrow\), so \(t_{\text{eff}} \uparrow\).  
  → Refresh stability demands increase in strong gravitational fields.

---

## 6. Dilatation Factor
- Perceptual dilation in this framework:
  \[
  \gamma_{\text{viz}}(x,v,\rho,\mathcal{K}) = N_n \cdot \frac{1}{F(x,v,\rho,\mathcal{K})}
  \]
- Relativity’s Lorentz factor (velocity):
  \[
  \gamma_{\text{rel}}(v) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
  \]
- Gravitational time dilation (curvature):
  \[
  \gamma_{\text{grav}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{2GM}{rc^2}}}
  \]
- Mapping: \(\gamma_{\text{viz}} \leftrightarrow \gamma_{\text{rel}}, \gamma_{\text{grav}}\) when \(F(x,v,\rho,\mathcal{K})\) incorporates both velocity and curvature modulation.

---

## 7. Consequences
- **Velocity stress:** Near‑light speed → extreme Doppler shifts, ordering artefacts harder → refresh stability demands grow.  
- **Curvature stress:** High density/curvature → gravitational time dilation → refresh stability demands grow.  
- **Unified principle:** Both velocity and density/curvature increase the burden on refresh stability, consistent with relativity.

---

## 8. Conclusion
- The tick–refresh model reproduces **special relativity** (velocity time dilation) and **general relativity** (gravitational time dilation).  
- **Planck tick** and **speed of light** remain invariant.  
- **Frame time** grows with velocity and curvature, requiring stronger stability mechanisms.  
- This confirms full compatibility of the tick–refresh framework with relativity across both domains.
