# Tick-Frame Physics Glossary

**Comprehensive reference for terms, symbols, and acronyms used in v2 framework**

---

## A

**Adjacency Principle** - The principle that entities can only interact with immediate neighbors in the tick-stream
spatial lattice. See v1/15_10.

**Antiexistence** - The geometric tendency to reduce or erase structured curvature. Antiexistence is self-terminating:
it destroys the very curvature required for its own continuation. See Ch13 §2.

**Aliasing (Temporal)** - Loss of intermediate states when a process evolves faster than observer's sampling rate,
creating perceptual distortions. See Ch1 §10.

**Auditable Agency** - The tick-frame definition of free will: constrained choice within deterministic causality where
all decisions are traceable. See Ch5 §4.

---

## B

**Big Bang (Observer-Relative)** - The concept that each observer's "beginning of time" is their birth tick, not a
universal event. See Ch4 §8.

**Bootup Window** - The early developmental phase (childhood) during which an entity's hill is initialized with high
plasticity, low noise, and high sensitivity to imprint. See Ch13 §9.4.

**Bucketing** - O(n) rendering algorithm that groups entities by discrete temporal lag instead of sorting. See Ch6 §3,
REFERENCE_doc46_01.

**Buffer (Existence)** - The finite temporal window an observer has access to: current tick (consciousness) + past
ticks (memory). See Ch1 §3, Ch4 §3.

---

## C

**Causal Locality** - Principle that information propagates at most 1 spatial quantum per tick (v ≤ c). See Ch1 §5, Ch7
§2.

**Causal Readability** - Requirement that State(n+1) must be derivable from State(n) for universe coherence. See Ch1 §7.

**Collision Persistence** - Theory that particles are collision patterns, not objects; collisions are entity types, not
events. See Ch3 §3, v1/30.

**Compatibilism** - Philosophical position that free will is compatible with determinism; tick-frame adopts this stance.
See Ch5 §4.

**Configuration Independence** - Empirical finding that physics is independent of initial geometry at d≥3 (Hypothesis H2
falsified). See Ch2 §6.

**Consciousness** - In tick-frame: presence at current tick with self-referential awareness. See Ch4 §4.

**Compatibility Maximization Principle** - Entities move, rotate, and imprint in ways that maximize compatibility
between their signature, local field, and surrounding gradients. Core metric of survival. See Ch10 §8.

**Cooperative Curvature Principle** - Cooperation is a geometric necessity: cooperating processes raise the hill
faster than isolated ones, gaining more energy collectively. See Ch13 §6.

**Curvature Duality** - The fact that identical gravitational curvature can be interpreted as either a well or a hill,
with radically different energetic consequences. See Ch12 §7.

---

## D

**Domestication (Hill)** - Long-term synchronization of a lower hill (animal) to a higher hill (human) through sustained
shared-hill exposure. Reduces reactivity and aligns behavior with the higher hill. See Ch13 §10.3.

**Déjà Vu** - Explained as index collision: current tick pattern matches historical tick, triggering false recognition.
See Ch4 §7.

**Determinism (Substrate)** - The tick-stream is fully causal with no randomness; State(n+1) = F(State(n)). See Ch5 §2.

**Cross-Hill Synchronization** - The process by which one entity's hill adjusts its gradients and regeneration rules
to match those of another entity, driven by shared imprint and overlapping windows. See Ch13 §10.2.

**Dimensional Closure** - The finding that spatial dimensions beyond 4D-5D provide diminishing returns in stability.
Refers to spatial dimensions only, NOT spacetime. See Ch2 §8.

**Dimensional Equivalence** - The hypothesis (falsified) that (n spatial + time) behaves like (n+1) spatial dimensions.
See Ch1 §9, REFERENCE_doc50_01.

**Dispersion (Wave)** - High-frequency waves travel slower than c in discrete space due to lattice effects. See Ch7 §4.

**Double-Buffer** - Synchronization technique where simulation fills one buffer while rendering reads another, enabling
lock-free coordination. See Ch6 §7.

**Dreams** - Explained as unconstrained buffer traversal during sleep when causal filter weakens. See Ch4 §7.

---

## E

**Energy-Time Relation** - Core formula: E(t) = (t - t_birth) in tick units, or E = hbar/t_planck × n in physical units.
See Ch3 §5, Ch7 §3.

**Entity** - Temporal process (not object) that responds to ticks via TickTimeConsumer<E> interface. See Ch1 §1, Ch3.

**Existence** - The geometric tendency to increase structured curvature. Self-reinforcing: raising the hill generates
surplus, which enables further hill-raising. See Ch13 §2.

**Existence Buffer** - See Buffer (Existence).

**Existential Boundary Principle** - Outside the gamma field, gradients collapse to zero. Leaving the field = ceasing
to exist. See Ch10 §7.

**Existential Drag Principle** - Interaction with the gamma field imposes drag (cost of survival) but also provides the
gradients required for persistence. See Ch10 §4.

**Expansion (Substrate)** - Space grows with tick count; later generations experience higher movement costs. See Ch3 §4.

---

## F

**Fallible Commit Principle** - Once observer commits tick allocation, it's irreversible; observers can make mistakes.
See Ch5 §8.

**Falsification Criteria** - Six testable predictions for the framework: Planck-scale dispersion, 3D optimality,
rotation asymmetry, rho=2.0 signature, O(n) rendering, energy balance. See Ch8 §5.

**Frame (Temporal)** - Bundle of ticks that observers perceive as single unit, hiding substrate details. See Ch5 §3.

**Fragment** - Transient process with subcritical gamma well (W < W_crit). Cannot self-maintain; dissipates unless
absorbed. Three types: radial, torsional, diffusive. See Ch11 §5.

**Frame-of-Reference Inversion Principle** - Classical physics misidentifies gamma-field wavefront propagation as
photon motion. The photon is stationary; the field propagates. See Ch11 §2.3.

**Free Will** - Tick-frame definition: auditable agency within determinism (constrained choice, not escape from
causality). See Ch5.

**Furrow-Bridging** - The deliberate extension of one observer's perceptual boundary into another's domain through
technology (cameras, transmitters, screens). See Ch9 §9.

---

## G

**Gamma Attraction Principle** - Entities cluster inside the gamma field because outside it, no gradients support
continued existence. Clustering = existential migration. See Ch10 §3.

**Gamma Field** - Scalar field γ(x, t) defined over the discrete spatial lattice, updated each tick through smoothing,
diffusion, and normalization. The fundamental substrate of entity existence. See Ch10.

**Gamma Furrow** - The observer's past light cone in gamma-field dynamics: the set of all events whose imprints have
reached the observer by the current tick. See Ch9 §2.

**Gamma Hill** - The rising-surface interpretation of gamma-field curvature (as opposed to the well interpretation).
Entities ride the hill; the hill rises beneath them through energy accumulation. See Ch12 §6-§8.

**Gamma Horizon** - The temporal bubble around each observer where the present is inaccessible, the past is observable,
and the future is constrained by propagation limits. See Ch9 §7.4.

**Gamma Imprint** - A localized perturbation of the gamma field produced by an entity at a specific position and tick.
All observation is detection of past imprints. See Ch9 §7.

**Gamma Imprint Cone** - The expanding cone-like structure formed by stacking imprint fronts over ticks. The gamma-field
analogue of a light cone. See Ch9 §8.3.

**Gamma Slingshot Principle** - When an entity enters a region of steep gradient, the tangential component can accelerate
it and redirect it into a new orbit. See Ch10 §6.

**Gamma Spectrum Hypothesis** - All wave phenomena (sound, light, gravitational waves) are manifestations of gamma-field
imprint propagation at different scales. See Ch9 §8.5.

**Gamma Wake** - A region of reduced expansion drift created by a large entity's imprint resisting expansion. The basis
of emergent gravity (cost gradient). See Ch11 §3.

**Gamma Well** - Local deformation of the gamma field caused by an entity's history. The integral of past imprints, the
entity's natural potential and reference frame. See Ch11 §4. (Note: same geometry as Gamma Hill, opposite
interpretational frame — see Ch12 §11.4.)

**Generation** - Distance from origin in entity lineage; affects movement costs due to expansion. See Ch3 §6.

**Goldilocks Zone (3D)** - Three spatial dimensions are optimal (SPBI=2.23), balancing stability and variability. See
Ch2 §3.

**Gravity (Tick-Frame)** - Proposed as time-flow gradient or substrate expansion effect (highly speculative). See Ch4
§6, Ch7 §9.

---

## H

**Hill Hierarchy** - When two hills interact, a hierarchy emerges based on stability and coherence. The higher
(more stable, slower-time) hill dominates; the lower (more reactive) hill synchronizes to it. See Ch13 §10.1.

**Hill Model** - The interpretation of gamma-field curvature where entities ride a rising surface rather than sitting
in a well. The hill rises beneath entities through energy accumulation; entities don't climb. See Ch12 §8.

**Hill Ontology** - The philosophical framework extending curvature geometry to existence, life, and consciousness.
Entities that raise curvature (existence) persist; those that flatten it (antiexistence) self-terminate. See Ch13.

**Horizon Boundary** - Observable limit in causal cones beyond which entities cannot interact within finite ticks. See
v1/26.

---

## I

**Identity** - In tick-frame: continuity across ticks (temporal trajectory), not persistent substance. See Ch1 §9, Ch4
§2.

**Imbalance Theory** - Prediction that matter-antimatter asymmetry emerges from expansion geometry even with symmetric
initial conditions. See Ch3 §4.

**Index Collision** - See Déjà Vu.

---

## L

**Lag (Temporal)** - How many ticks behind current tick an entity is; used as depth coordinate in rendering. See Ch6 §4.

**Learning (Hill)** - The incorporation of foreign imprints into an entity's own hill without resetting the window.
Partial hill fusion constrained by compatibility between learner's existing gradients and foreign imprint. See Ch13 §9.

**Lag-Based Inertia** - Inertia reinterpreted as accumulated temporal lag. The more energy bound in maintaining a gamma
well, the harder it is to redirect. See Ch11 §4.

**Lag-Shear Radiation** - Radiation emitted when an entity's imprint shear exceeds structural tolerance, analogous to
synchrotron radiation. See Ch12 §4.

**Laplace's Demon** - Hypothetical that knows all states and can predict future; possible at substrate level but not for
bounded observers. See Ch5 §2.

**Linked List (Temporal Chain)** - Data structure that mirrors temporal entity chains; enables O(1) bucket clearing. See
Ch6 §9.

**Lorentz Transform** - Special relativity transformation; tick-frame derivation speculative (not yet completed). See
Ch7 §9.

---

## M

**MAX_HISTORY** - Maximum buffer depth (e.g., 100-1000 ticks); determines memory capacity. See Ch4 §3.

**Memory (as Addressing)** - Brain indexes historical ticks rather than storing them; memory is pointer to tick, not
copy. See Ch4 §3.

**Minkowski Spacetime** - Relativity framework where time is coordinate; tick-frame decisively different (rho=2.0 vs
rho=1.5). See Ch1 §9, Ch8 §8.

**Momentum (Tick-Frame)** - Pair (cost, vector): tick cost to move + spatial direction. See Ch3 §6.

---

## N

Ch7 §4.

---

## O

**Observer** - Entity with self-referential loop, historical buffer access, and selective perception. Function: tick n →
tick n+1. See Ch4.

**O(n) Complexity** - Linear time complexity; bucketing achieves this for rendering vs O(n log n) sorting. See Ch6 §3.

**Ontology (Temporal)** - Framework establishing time as primary substrate, space as emergent. See Ch1, REFERENCE_doc49.

**Over-Coherence** - Current implementation problem: structures too uniform, expected asymmetry not observed. See Ch3
§11, Ch8 §4.

---

## P

**Painter's Algorithm** - Classical rendering: sort by depth, paint back-to-front. Tick-frame uses bucketing instead.
See Ch6 §10.

**Perception (Selective)** - Observer actively filters which entities to track based on tick budget. See Ch4 §5.

**Phase Transition (d=3)** - At 3 dimensions, rho becomes universal (configuration-independent). See Ch2 §4.

**Planck Scale** - Fundamental units: t_planck ≈ 5.39×10^-44 s, l_planck ≈ 1.62×10^-35 m. Tick-frame identifies tick =
t_planck. See Ch7 §2.

**Position** - N-dimensional spatial coordinate (BigInteger array); represents multiples of l_planck. See Ch3 §1, Ch7
§2.

---

## Q

**Qualia** - Subjective "what it's like" experience; tick-frame suggests emerges from self-referential indexing (
speculative). See Ch4 §4.

**Quantum Mechanics** - Tick-frame provides discrete substrate; QM may emerge as continuous limit. See Ch7 §4.

---

## R

**Radial Curvature** - The component of gamma-field curvature along the radial direction from an entity. Identified
with gravity in the EM unification framework: W_radial = gravity. See Ch12 §3.

**Ratchet Effect** - Temporal coupling creates energy accumulation (not dilution); explains rho=2.0 signature. See Ch1
§4.

**Rising Hill Principle** - Entities do not climb the gamma hill; the hill rises beneath them as they accumulate energy
and reinforce local curvature. See Ch12 §8.

**Rendering (Temporal)** - Using lag as depth coordinate to visualize 2D space + time as 3D scene. See Ch6.

**Rho (ρ)** - Scaling exponent in S ∝ N^rho; spatial dimensions show rho≈1.5, temporal systems show rho=2.0. See Ch1 §9,
Ch2 §3.

**Rotation Asymmetry** - 933× difference: forward pitch 0% (impossible), backward pitch 93% (energy-limited). Validates
v ≤ c. See Ch6 §5.

---

## S

**Sample Rate Limit** - Maximum velocity v = c = 1 spatial quantum / tick; exceeding causes aliasing/breakdown. See Ch1
§5, Ch6 §6.

**Sampling (Observer)** - How observer selects which ticks/entities to process; constrained by tick budget. See Ch4 §5.

**Schrödinger Equation (Discrete)** - Finite-difference version on tick lattice; continuous equation emerges in limit.
See Ch7 §4.

**Sleep** - Computational necessity to clear buffer saturation; prevents sampling collapse and coherence loss. See Ch4
§6.

**SPBI (Stability-Probability Balance Index)** - Metric combining stability (low variance) and richness (high
probability); 3D achieves maximum SPBI=2.23. See Ch2 §3.

**Shared Hill** - A region of the imprint field accessible to multiple entities whose windows overlap sufficiently to
allow mutual influence. Enables communication, cooperation, cultural transmission, and teaching. See Ch13 §9.1.

**Substrate** - The fundamental tick-stream that generates existence; discrete, causal, ordered. See Ch1 §2.

**Stellar Collapse** - In hill ontology, catastrophic loss of hill height when energy input fails to sustain curvature.
Results in explosive reconfiguration (supernova). See Ch13 §5.

**Surfing (Temporal)** - Entities persist through continual renewal each tick, not through static identity. See Ch3 §2.

---

## T

**Tangential Curvature** - The component of gamma-field curvature perpendicular to the radial direction. Identified
with magnetism in the EM unification framework: W_tangential = magnetism. See Ch12 §3.

**Teaching (Hill)** - The deliberate creation of stable imprints in the shared hill for others to incorporate. Teachers
shape gradients, filter noise, compress knowledge, and guide hill formation in learners. See Ch13 §9.7.

**Terminal Hill State** - The maximum curvature configuration: perfect coherence, self-sustaining, with maximal time
dilation. Identified with black holes. See Ch13 §3.

**Temporal Ontology** - See Ontology (Temporal).

**Ternary Logic** - Three-value system {-1, 0, +1} providing symmetry and richer dynamics than binary. See Ch5 §6.

**Tick** - Fundamental time quantum = Planck time (t_planck ≈ 5.39×10^-44 s). Universe updates every tick. See Ch1 §2,
Ch7 §2.

**Tick Budget** - Computational resources available to observer per tick; determines perception capacity. See Ch4 §5,
Ch5 §5.

**Tick-Stream** - Strictly ordered sequence of universal states: tick 0 → tick 1 → tick 2 → ...; absolute temporal
substrate. See Ch1 §2.

**TickTimeConsumer<E>** - Java interface for temporal processes: onTick(tickCount) returns action stream. See Ch3 §9.

**Trauma** - High-salience tick with low activation threshold; disproportionately easy to recall. See Ch4 §7.

---

## U

**Uncertainty (Frame-Level)** - Observers perceive probabilistic outcomes due to coarse-graining, though substrate is
deterministic. See Ch5 §3.

**Utility Function** - What observer optimizes when allocating tick budget. See Ch5 §5.

---

## V

**Value Class (Java)** - Immutable class with value semantics; SingleEntityModel is value class representing patterns
not objects. See Ch3 §9.

**Velocity (Maximum)** - v_max = c = l_planck / t_planck; structural constant, not derived. See Ch7 §2.

**Void Asymmetry** - Presence (+1) costs energy, absence (0) is default; action requires justification. See Ch5 §9.

---

## W

**Wave Equation (Discrete)** - Finite-difference formulation: A(n+1) = 2A(n) - A(n-1) + spatial Laplacian. See Ch7 §4.

**Window of Existence** - The finite temporal span within which an entity maintains structural coherence. Reproduction
resets the window while preserving essential hill geometry. See Ch13 §8.

accumulated noise while consolidating core hill structure. See Ch13 §8.

---
