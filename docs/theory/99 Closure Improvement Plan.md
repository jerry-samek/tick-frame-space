# Closure Improvement Plan

This plan transforms the foundational framework into a testable, mathematically grounded, and empirically evaluable theory. Milestones are ordered for dependency and momentum, with clear deliverables and decision gates.

---

## Phase 1: Formalization Prototype

**Objective:** Define minimal mathematics for root, implementation, visualization, and debugger.

**Deliverables:**
- **Root formalism:** Finite axiomatic system \( \mathcal{R} \) with generative operator \( G \) producing implementation states \( I \).
- **Visualization operator:** Collapse map \( C: I \to V \) constrained by invariants and locality.
- **Debugger functional:** Verification operator \( \mathcal{D} \) returning a coherence score for \( C(I) \) under invariants.
- **Invariance set:** Explicit list of invariants (e.g., conservation, symmetry constraints) used by \( \mathcal{D} \).

**Decision Gate:** Prototype produces non-trivial examples where \( \mathcal{D} \) distinguishes coherent vs incoherent collapses.

---

## Phase 2: Differential Predictions

**Objective:** Identify predictions that distinguish the framework from alternatives.

**Deliverables:**
- **Prediction A (Parameter Consolidation):** Effective number of independent physical constants trends downward with deeper theory.
- **Prediction B (Cross-Domain Invariants):** Presence of conservation-like quantities in non-physical systems (algorithms, evolution).
- **Prediction C (Coherence Bounds):** Systems maximizing coherence (per \( \mathcal{D} \)) exhibit superior stability/persistence.
- **Prediction D (Finite Encodability of Infinities):** Infinite-like phenomena are compressible by finite grammars.

**Decision Gate:** Each prediction has an operational test and a criterion for pass/fail that competing theories do not jointly satisfy.

---

## Phase 3: Empirical Metrics and Datasets

**Objective:** Operationalize measurement and select datasets.

**Deliverables:**
- **Coherence metric:** Composite score (e.g., thermodynamic efficiency, symmetry compliance, compressibility).
- **Potency metric for agents:** Scalar measure linking persistence to coherence.
- **Parameter consolidation index:** Time series metric across historical physics models.
- **Datasets:**
  - Physics: constants, symmetry groups, model timelines.
  - Biology: evolutionary lineages, fitness landscapes.
  - Computation: algorithmic outputs, generative grammars.

**Decision Gate:** Metrics demonstrate reliability, discriminability, and alignment with at least one differential prediction.

---

## Phase 4: Simulation Studies

**Objective:** Validate coherence and potency claims in controlled environments.

**Deliverables:**
- **Toy universe:** Finite grammar → state machine → collapse rules; evaluate \( \mathcal{D} \).
- **Evolutionary simulation:** Agents mutate under constraints; test if higher \( \mathcal{D} \) predicts persistence.
- **Cross-domain invariance detection:** Apply symmetry search to computational and biological processes.

**Decision Gate:** Simulations show statistically significant correlation between coherence and persistence; finite encodability demonstrated.

---

## Phase 5: Physics Consistency Tests

**Objective:** Align with quantum and relativity; seek mild-risk predictions.

**Deliverables:**
- **Quantum alignment:** Map \( C \) to decoherence; test if coherence predicts collapse robustness.
- **Relativity alignment:** Show invariance set recovers Lorentz symmetry; track parameter consolidation.
- **Boundary claims:** Define what the framework forbids (e.g., parameter proliferation, meta-selection).

**Decision Gate:** At least one mild-risk test produces supportive evidence or sharpens falsification criteria.

---

## Phase 6: Documentation and Peer Challenge

**Objective:** Harden the theory via external critique.

**Deliverables:**
- **Technical paper:** Formal definitions, metrics, simulations, predictions.
- **Open repository:** Code, datasets, benchmarks, audit trail.
- **Red-team protocol:** Invite critiques targeting Disproof Criteria and consciousness operationalization.

**Decision Gate:** Address top critiques; retain core claims or refactor based on evidence.
