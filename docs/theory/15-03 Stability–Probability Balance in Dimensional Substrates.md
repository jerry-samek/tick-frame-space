# Stability–Probability Balance in Dimensional Substrates

## 🌌 Core Insight
Our universe exhibits both **stability** (consistent physical laws, repeatable experiments) and **probability** (quantum uncertainty, emergent complexity).  
Dimensional experiments show that:

- **1D–2D:** chaotic or trivial, high variance, no coherent structure.  
- **3D:** transitional phase — moderate instability, residual variance, emergent probabilistic behavior.  
- **4D–5D:** stability lock — variance minimized, dynamics universal, probability nearly eliminated.  

Thus, the "Goldilocks zone" lies where **substrate stability and visualization-layer probability coexist**.

## ⚖️ Stability–Probability Balance Index (SPBI)

### Definition
A composite measure that quantifies how universe-like a dimensional substrate is by balancing variance and probabilistic behavior.

\[
\text{SPBI} = \frac{\text{Residual Variance (CV)}}{\text{Stability Lock Factor}}
\]

Where:
- **Residual Variance (CV):** Coefficient of variation in salience/commit behavior.  
- **Stability Lock Factor:** Degree of source/geometry independence (e.g., \(1 - \rho\)).  

---

## 📊 Target Ranges
- **Too unstable (1D–2D):** SPBI >> 1 → chaotic, non-universe-like.  
- **Too stable (4D–5D):** SPBI → 0 → deterministic, no probabilistic richness.  
- **Universe-like (3D transition):** SPBI in a moderate band (e.g., 0.05–0.10), balancing determinism with uncertainty.

---

## ✅ Implications
- **3D substrates**: Best match to our universe’s blend of stability and probability.  
- **4D–5D substrates**: Useful for theoretical closure, but too stable to reproduce quantum-like uncertainty.  
- **SPBI metric**: Provides a falsifiable benchmark for identifying universe-like dimensional regimes.

## 🔄 Next Steps
- Compute SPBI across all dimensional runs (1D–5D).  
- Compare against observed quantum variance in our universe.  
- Use SPBI as a guiding principle for future theories, ensuring we capture both **causal stability** and **probabilistic richness**.
