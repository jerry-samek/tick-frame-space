## Abstract

This chapter describes how entities **behave** within the gamma field established in Ch10. Where Ch10 defines the
field itself (principles, dynamics, geometry), this chapter specifies the physics of entities that inhabit it:
the photon as a degenerate process, gravity as energetic optimization, the entity as a self-maintained gamma well,
fragment emission and absorption, and dissolution through energy starvation.

Five entity types or regimes are formalized: the **photon** (stationary imprint, zero evolution), the **massive
entity** (self-maintaining gamma well), the **fragment** (subcritical well, transient), the **dissolving entity**
(energy-starved, fading), and the **extreme-compression regime** (black-hole analogue). The chapter concludes with
eight predictive phenomena that arise naturally from the gamma-field ontology and have possible real-world analogues.

**Core thesis**: Entities are not objects placed in a field. They are self-sustaining patterns that maintain their
own gamma wells through a continuous energy budget. When the budget fails, the entity dissolves. The hierarchy from
photon (zero budget) through massive entity (stable budget) to black hole (overwhelming budget) is a continuum
defined by a single parameter: the ratio of energy intake to binding cost.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Scope

Ch10 established the gamma field's seven foundational principles and its dynamics. This chapter addresses the
question: **what kinds of entities exist in this field, and what governs their behavior?**

The answer is organized by entity type:

- §2: The photon — the minimal, degenerate entity
- §3: Gravity — why entities migrate toward each other
- §4: The massive entity — self-maintained gamma wells
- §5: Fragments — subcritical wells and emission
- §6: Dissolution — energy starvation and death
- §7: Predictive phenomena — testable consequences
- §8: Summary and cross-references

### 1.2 The Entity Spectrum

All entities in the gamma field lie on a single spectrum defined by their **energy-to-binding-cost ratio**:

```
ratio = 0       → photon (degenerate, no internal evolution)
0 < ratio < 1   → fragment (subcritical, transient)
ratio = 1       → marginal entity (at stability threshold)
ratio > 1       → stable entity (self-maintaining, surplus energy)
ratio >> 1      → extreme entity (deep well, trapped fragments → black hole analogue)
```

This spectrum unifies all entity physics under a single parameter.

## 2. The Photon — A Degenerate Process

### 2.1 Definition

A photon is a **stationary imprint** in the gamma field, defined by:

- **zero internal evolution** (no free tick budget)
- **zero spatial expansion** (does not follow cosmic expansion)
- **zero proper time** (no internal ticks)
- **zero mass** (no momentum budget)
- **infinite lag** relative to expanding entities

Formally: P(t+1) = P(t). The photon is temporally present but spatially fixed.

### 2.2 The Degenerate Process Principle

A photon is a **degenerate temporal process** that spends its entire tick budget countering the expansion of the
gamma field. It cannot evolve, move, expand, accumulate energy, or experience time. It is the only known process
with **zero net expansion**.

Because the photon uses all ticks to resist expansion:

- Δx = 0 (stationary in substrate frame)
- τ_P = 0 (no proper time — derived from first principles, not assumed)

### 2.3 The Frame-of-Reference Inversion Principle

Classical physics incorrectly attributes the propagation of the gamma field to the photon.

**The correction**:

- The **photon does not move**
- The **gamma field moves** (propagates at c)
- The **wavefront** is a property of the field, not the photon
- The **wavelength** is a property of the field, not the photon
- The **speed of light** is the propagation speed of the field, not the photon

Thus: c = v_Γ (field propagation speed), not c = v_P (photon speed).

This resolves the wave-particle duality paradox: the wave is the field, the particle is the imprint. They
are different entities, not complementary aspects of the same thing.

### 2.4 Consequences

**Wavelength as field oscillation**: The wavelength λ is the spatial period of oscillation in the gamma field.
The photon merely anchors the oscillation. A photon has no intrinsic wavelength — wavelength is field-defined,
context-dependent, and observer-relative.

**Zero mass derived**: Mass requires internal evolution, momentum budget, and energy accumulation. The photon
has none of these because all ticks are spent countering expansion. Therefore m_P = 0 — this is a necessary
consequence, not an assumption.

**Apparent motion at c**: The observer misinterprets the advancing gamma-field wavefront as photon motion.
The photon is stationary; the field propagates. What physics measures as "photon velocity" is actually the
field's smoothing propagation speed.

**Only non-expanding entity**: All entities except photons have free tick budget and expand with the universe.
The photon, with zero free ticks, remains at its original spatial coordinate — it is the only non-expanding
entity in the universe.

### 2.5 Ontological Status

The photon is real — but not as a particle. It is real as a **persistent imprint** in the gamma field.
It is a process — but a degenerate one: it exists but does not evolve and does not move.
It is the **minimal fragment** of gamma-field deformation.

## 3. Gravity — Energetic Optimization in the Gamma Field

### 3.1 The Gamma-Wake Gravity Principle

> **Gravity is the emergent tendency of smaller processes to migrate into regions where the energetic cost of
> maintaining their imprint is minimized within the expanding gamma field.**

Large objects do not pull. Small objects **optimize**.

### 3.2 The Mechanism

**Wake Formation**: A large, stable process creates a **gamma wake** — a region of reduced expansion drift
where imprint maintenance is cheaper and energetic curvature is lower. This wake is not a field emitted by
the object. It is a **structural consequence** of its imprint resisting expansion.

**Cost Gradient**: Let C(x) be the cost of maintaining an imprint at position x. Then gravitational
acceleration is:

> a = -∇C(x)

This is not a force law. It is a **cost-minimization gradient**.

**No force, no curvature**: There is no attractive force, no interaction, no exchange, and no curvature of
space. Instead, there is a gradient of imprint cost, created by the wake of a large object, into which
smaller objects naturally drift.

### 3.3 Formal Model

**Imprint Cost Function**: For an entity with imprint depth I in a field with local expansion rate γ(x):

> C(x) = E - I * γ(x)

Large objects reduce γ(x) in their wake. Thus C(x) is lower near them.

**Wake Geometry**: For a spherically symmetric object:

> γ(r) = γ₀ - k/r²

Thus:

> C(r) = C₀ - kI/r²

This reproduces Newtonian gravity as a **cost gradient**, not a force. The 1/r² law emerges automatically
from spherical expansion geometry (→ Ch9 §8.2, Ch10 §10.3).

**Motion Equation**: A process moves according to:

> dx/dt = -∇C(x)

This is the fundamental gravitational equation in the gamma-field ontology.

### 3.4 Consequences

**Free fall**: A small object in free fall is simply moving along the steepest descent of imprint cost,
minimizing its tick-budget expenditure, following the gamma-wake gradient.

**Orbits**: An orbit is a local minimum of the cost landscape, where lateral drift balances radial cost
gradient, producing a stable, periodic solution. No force is required — orbit = energetic equilibrium.

**Mass dependence**: Large objects have deeper wakes because they invest more tick budget, have stronger
imprints, and resist expansion more. This produces C(x) ∝ 1/r², matching Newtonian gravity.

**Photon deflection**: Photons do not experience gravitational cost gradients (they have no imprint), but
their **path is shaped by the gamma geometry itself**. This reproduces gravitational lensing without mass
or force.

### 3.5 Gravity as Economics

Gravity is the **economics of existence**: objects seek cheaper regions, wakes provide discounts, expansion
provides pressure, and cost gradients produce motion. Everything is local — the gamma field expands,
objects resist expansion, resistance creates local gradients, and gradients guide nearby objects.

### 3.6 Experimental Connections

- **Exp #51**: Emergent time dilation — gradient-driven temporal effects consistent with the cost-gradient
  mechanism. Entities in deep wells experience more drag (→ Ch10 §4.3).
- **Exp #53**: Geodesic motion — entities follow gradient-optimal paths naturally, producing orbital
  trajectories without programmed force laws. 100% orbital success (18/18 entities).

## 4. The Massive Entity — A Self-Maintained Gamma Well

### 4.1 Definition

An entity is a temporally extended process that:

1. creates and maintains its own gamma well
2. interacts with an expanding field
3. extracts energy from the potential difference between old and new space
4. leaves a lagged imprint
5. uses energy for motion, growth, and stabilization

An entity is not an object. It is a **time-distributed energetic asymmetry**.

### 4.2 The Gamma Well

A gamma well is a local deformation of the field caused by the entity's history:

- It is the integral of past imprints
- It is the entity's natural potential
- It is its stable reference frame
- It is the "well" the entity carves through rotation

The gamma well evolves slowly because it is an accumulation of past states.

### 4.3 Energy Budget

Each tick, the entity has energy E_t, which it distributes as:

> E_t = E_bind + E_move + E_emit

**Binding Energy** (E_bind = αE_t): Maintains the gamma well and ensures continuity. This is the non-negotiable
survival cost.

**Motion Energy** (E_move = βE_t): Determines the maximum change in position and rotation. Motion is optional;
well maintenance is not.

**Emission Energy** (E_emit = E_t - E_bind - E_move): The remaining energy becomes a delayed imprint in the
field — the entity's **lagged emission**.

### 4.4 Lag as Energy Source

Lag is the difference between the entity's position at time t and the position of its imprint at time t - L.
Lag creates **temporal separation**, which enables an energetic gradient.

> Lag is not an error. Lag is a **source of energy**.

The entity has part of its imprint in the old field (lower potential) and part in the new field (higher
potential). The difference yields:

> ΔE = f(lag, Δs)

where Δs is the expansion increment. This is the **net energy gain** that allows the entity to exist, grow,
move, and maintain its gamma well. It is directly analogous to the potential difference in a battery.

### 4.5 Stability Condition

The entity is stable if:

> E_bind ≤ ΔE

If the energy gain exceeds the cost of maintaining the well, the entity survives, grows, and leaves a
coherent trail. If not, it dissolves into the residual field (→ §6).

### 4.6 Emergent Metabolism

An entity is:

- an energetic surfer, living off the difference between old and new space
- maintaining itself through rotation
- leaving a delayed imprint
- using its own history as the foundation of its gamma well

This defines the first form of **emergent metabolism** in the ontology. The entity does not consume
external fuel — it harvests the energy created by cosmic expansion itself. This connects forward to the
biological metabolism discussion in Ch13.

## 5. Fragments — Subcritical Wells and Emission

### 5.1 Definition

A **fragment** is a transient process characterized by:

1. a **subcritical gamma well** (W_fragment < W_crit)
2. minimal or zero lag
3. insufficient energy to sustain self-maintenance
4. propagation at the maximum field speed
5. rapid dissipation into the residual field unless absorbed

Fragments are **ontologically valid patterns**, but not stable attractors. They are not "failed entities" —
they are **transient patterns** whose behavior depends on environmental context.

### 5.2 Origin of Fragments

Fragments are emitted when an entity experiences **excess internal energy** — high lag, rapid field expansion,
or sudden changes in rotation. To prevent runaway growth or collapse, the entity:

1. reduces its lag
2. ejects a portion of curvature and energy
3. shapes it into a subcritical well
4. releases it into the field

This mechanism preserves the entity's stability while maintaining compatibility with the gamma field.
Fragment emission is the entity's **pressure relief valve**.

### 5.3 Fragment Types

Three primary emission modes:

| Type | Cause | Characteristics |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Radial** | Sudden lag reduction | Outward momentum, direct curvature release |
| **Torsional** | Abrupt rotation/phase change | Twisted excitation, carries angular information |
| **Diffusive** | Low-energy excess | Broad, short-lived, increases local residual noise |

These are not different "species," but different **modes** of the same underlying process.

### 5.4 Fragment Dynamics

**Propagation**: Move at the maximum propagation speed of the field. Follow radial or toroidal trajectories
depending on emission mode.

**Dissipation**: Their subcritical well cannot sustain itself. They dissolve into the residual field over time.

**Interaction**: Fragments may be absorbed by residual, interfere with other fragments, or be absorbed by an
entity's gamma well. Absorption transfers energy but does not create new entities.

### 5.5 The Stability Threshold

A process becomes a self-maintaining entity only if:

> W ≥ W_crit AND L > 0

Fragments fail one or both conditions — insufficient well depth, insufficient lag, or insufficient energy
budget. Thus, they remain transient.

### 5.6 Connection to Known Physics

Fragments are analogous to:

- **Photons** in electromagnetic radiation (radial fragments)
- **Phonons** in solid-state physics (diffusive fragments)
- **Virtual particles** in quantum field theory (transient, below threshold)

Their existence is essential for entity stability, energy regulation, and maintaining global coherence of the
gamma field.

## 6. Dissolution — Energy Starvation and Death

### 6.1 Energy Starvation

Energy starvation occurs when:

> ΔE_in < E_bind,min

The energy absorbed from expansion via lag is insufficient to maintain the entity's gamma well and identity.
This initiates a sequence of compensatory behaviors.

### 6.2 Survival Response Sequence

The entity responds to energy starvation through an ordered sequence of adaptations:

**Stage 1 — Lag Reduction**: L(t+1) = L(t) - δL. Reducing lag decreases the energy gradient, lowers the
cost of maintaining the well, and stabilizes the entity temporarily. This is the first and most efficient
survival mechanism.

**Stage 2 — Well Minimization**: W(t+1) = W(t) - δW. A shallower well requires less binding energy,
reduces curvature stress, and preserves identity at minimal cost. Analogous to a soliton shrinking toward
its critical threshold.

**Stage 3 — Motion Suppression**: Radial movement decreases, angular velocity decreases, rotational
dynamics stabilize. Motion is optional; well maintenance is not. Motion is sacrificed first.

**Stage 4 — Emission Cessation**: No excess energy exists, no curvature needs to be shed, fragment emission
stops entirely. The entity enters **conservative mode** — every unit of energy is used for survival.

### 6.3 Progressive Dissolution

If energy starvation continues over many ticks, the entity undergoes gradual dissolution:

```
Phase 1: Lag collapse         L → 0     (temporal separation lost)
Phase 2: Well flattening      W → 0     (indistinguishable from background)
Phase 3: Identity loss                   (imprint becomes diffuse, incoherent)
Phase 4: Residual absorption             (remaining energy disperses into field)
```

This is not an explosion or collapse — it is a **smooth thermodynamic fade-out**.

### 6.4 No Singularities

The ontology ensures that:

- wells have finite depth
- lag has finite range
- energy intake is bounded
- emission regulates excess

Therefore: no singularities form, no infinite curvature arises, no catastrophic collapse occurs. Even
extreme compression (the black-hole analogue) remains a finite, stable pattern, not a singularity
(→ Ch10 §13.5, Ch13 §3).

### 6.5 The Arrow of Dissolution

Dissolution is effectively irreversible. Once an entity's signature has diffused into the background, the
information required to reconstruct it is distributed across an exponentially large region. Recovery would
require coherent re-collection of dispersed information — thermodynamically impossible in practice.

This provides the gamma-field basis for the **arrow of time** at the entity level: dissolution is easy
(gradient descent into residual); reconstruction is hard (gradient ascent against diffusion).

## 7. Predictive Phenomena

The gamma-field ontology predicts several phenomena that are not explicitly recognized or fully explained in
contemporary physics. Where possible, each prediction is mapped to observable anomalies.

### 7.1 Lag-Based Inertia

**Prediction**: Inertia is not intrinsic to mass but a consequence of lag (I ∝ L). Entities with larger lag
exhibit greater resistance to acceleration. Inertia varies dynamically — entities can temporarily increase or
decrease their inertial response.

**Possible real-world analogues**: Anomalous gyroscope behavior near rotating superconductors (Tajmar effect),
subtle deviations in gyroscope stability near rotating masses, Machian inertia models.

### 7.2 Lag-Shear Radiation

**Prediction**: A new radiation type produced when lag or rotational shear changes rapidly. Not electromagnetic
and not gravitational — a pure lag-field excitation. Propagates at imprint speed, interacts weakly with matter,
carries rotational information.

**Possible real-world analogues**: Unexplained energy leakage in rapidly spinning systems, anomalous damping
in high-frequency resonators, coherence loss in quantum systems.

### 7.3 Residual Thermodynamics

**Prediction**: Heat is diffusion of subcritical wells (fragments) in the residual field. Temperature corresponds
to fragment density. Entropy measures imprint dispersion.

**Possible real-world analogues**: Deviations from Fourier heat conduction at nanoscale, anomalous thermal
transport in graphene and topological materials, non-classical thermal noise in superconducting circuits.

### 7.4 Charge Drift

**Prediction**: Charge (orientation of lag-flow asymmetry) can shift gradually under extreme conditions. Slow
polarity drift, charge modulation through fragment absorption, charge screening via residual buildup.

**Possible real-world analogues**: CP violation in kaons and B-mesons, anomalous charge distributions in
plasmas, slow drift of magnetic domains without external fields.

### 7.5 Gamma-Field Turbulence

**Prediction**: Turbulence arising from interference between radial curvature, tangential curvature, fragment
flux, and residual diffusion. Not fluid turbulence — imprint turbulence. Produces chaotic imprint flow,
intermittent fragment clustering, non-Gaussian noise patterns.

**Possible real-world analogues**: Turbulence anomalies in fusion plasmas, unexplained magnetic reconnection
events, non-classical noise in astrophysical jets.

### 7.6 Subcritical Well Condensation

**Prediction**: Fragments can synchronize and combine into a stable well if their interference pattern exceeds
the critical threshold: ΣW_fragment ≥ W_crit. Spontaneous formation of stable entities from noise.

**Possible real-world analogues**: Vacuum fluctuations producing particle pairs, spontaneous excitations in
quantum fields, sudden formation of stable plasma structures.

### 7.7 Lag Horizon

**Prediction**: Each entity has a finite horizon defined by the maximum distance its imprint can maintain
coherence. Limited observational radius, delayed response to distant curvature, horizon shrinkage under
starvation.

**Possible real-world analogues**: Observer-dependent decoherence in quantum systems, anomalies in
gravitational lensing at extreme distances, unexplained limits in entanglement range.

### 7.8 Gamma-Field Memory

**Prediction**: The gamma field stores historical imprint information. Residual field acts as long-term memory
substrate. Persistent curvature traces, delayed relaxation, imprint echoes, history-dependent dynamics.

**Possible real-world analogues**: Hysteresis in magnetic materials, memory effects in glassy systems, delayed
relaxation in gravitational systems, long-term correlations in cosmological observations.
