# Tick-Frame Physics Theory (Version 2)

**Consolidated theoretical framework** - January 2026

This directory contains the v2 consolidated theory of tick-frame physics, synthesizing 76 raw documents (archived in
`raw/`) into a coherent framework with experimental validation.

---

## Quick Start

**New readers**: Start with **Ch1 (Temporal Ontology)** → **Ch2 (Dimensional Framework)** → **experiment_index.md** (see Exp 51, 55 breakthroughs!) → **Ch8 (Integration)**.

**Implementers**: Read **REFERENCE_doc15** (Java basis) → **Ch3 (Entity Dynamics)** → **Ch6 (Rendering)** → **experiments/55_collision_physics/** (reference implementation).

**Researchers**: Read **Ch7 (Formalization)** → **Ch8 (Falsification)** → **honest_status.md** (updated Jan 2026) → experimental docs in `../../experiments/`.

**Skeptics**: Read **REFERENCE_doc50_01** (smoking gun evidence) → **experiments/51_emergent_time_dilation/v10/RESULTS.md** (geodesics emerged!) → **experiments/55_collision_physics/** (Pauli exclusion emerged!) → **honest_status.md** (reality check).

## Framework Overview

### Core Thesis

**Time is discrete at the Planck scale and serves as the primary substrate from which space and entities emerge.**

**Key principles**:

1. **Temporal Primacy**: Entities are temporal processes, not objects in time (Ch1)
2. **3D Optimality**: Three spatial dimensions are optimal, not exclusive (Ch2)
3. **Sample Rate Limit**: Maximum speed v = c = 1 spatial quantum / tick (Ch1, Ch6, Ch7)
4. **Discrete Time Advantage**: O(n) rendering vs O(n log n) sorting (Ch6)
5. **Time ≠ Dimension**: Temporal systems show rho=2.0 vs spatial rho≈1.5 (Ch1)

### Validation Status (January 2026 Update)

✅ **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Core physics mechanisms validated computationally!

**Foundational Properties (Tier 0)**:
- Experiment #15: 3D optimal in certain field dynamics (3,960 simulations)
- Experiment #44: Kinematic constraint v ≤ c enforceable (rotation asymmetry)
- Experiment #50: ρ=2.0 signature (time ≠ dimension, 1,095 configs)
- Experiment #46_01: O(n) bucketing works (2.78× speedup @ 100k entities)

**Physics Mechanisms (Tier 1)** - NEW in January 2026:
- ✅ **Experiment #51 (v1-v9)**: Emergent time dilation VALIDATED (r ≈ 0.999 correlation with GR+SR)
- ✅ **Experiment #53 (v10)**: Geodesic motion VALIDATED (100% orbital success, NO FORCE LAWS programmed!)
- ✅ **Experiment #55**: Three-regime collision physics VALIDATED (6/6 test cases, exact energy conservation)
- ✅ **Experiment #55 DISCOVERY**: Pauli exclusion emerged naturally (NOT predicted - genuinely surprising!)
- ⚠️ **Experiment #52 (v11)**: Black hole c-ring discovered (awaiting collision validation v12)
- 🔄 **Experiment #56**: Composite objects (atoms/molecules) implemented, binding validation pending

**Current Status**: 9/10 validations successful (5/7 Tier 1 complete). Transitioned from "computational speculation" to "validated physics mechanisms."

**Confidence Level**: MODERATE-HIGH for emergent gravity/relativity mechanisms. Evidence accumulating that this is real physics, not just simulation artifacts.

⚠ **Implementation partial**: Java tick-space-runner realizes core patterns but has gaps (see Ch8 §4).

☐ **Real physics connection**: Still zero observational tests. But computational evidence now strong enough to warrant proposing real-world experiments.

## Key Questions Answered

### Q1: Is this a replacement for relativity/quantum mechanics?

**A**: No. Tick-frame explores discrete time at Planck scale as fundamental axiom. It's compatible with QM/relativity in
appropriate limits (see Ch7 §9), but formalization is incomplete. Think of it as **exploratory research**, not a rival
theory.

### Q2: What's the strongest evidence?

**A**: **Experiment 50** (rho=2.0 signature) - 1,095 configurations tested, 0% pass rate for dimensional equivalence,
universal quadratic scaling when time is treated as dimension. This is the **smoking gun** that time ≠ spatial
dimension.

### Q3: What's the weakest part?

**A**: **Relativity compatibility** (Ch7 §9) - Lorentz transforms not yet derived from discrete symmetries. Time
dilation mechanism is speculative. No observational tests yet.

### Q4: Can I test this experimentally?

**A**: **Computational**: Yes! Run experiments 15, 44, 50, 46_01 yourself (Python code in `../../experiments/`).

**Observational physics**: Not yet. Planck-scale effects (Ch7 §10) require ultra-high-energy cosmic rays or
gravitational wave dispersion measurements beyond current sensitivity.

### Q5: How does this relate to the Java code?

**A**: Java implements the **Doc 15 model** (see REFERENCE_doc015). Theory has evolved to **Doc 49** (see
REFERENCE_doc049). There's a gap (ontological refinement), but code is functionally correct. See Ch8 §4 for details.

### Q6: Is time travel possible in this framework?

**A**: **No**. Tick-stream is strictly ordered (Ch1 §2). You cannot move backward in tick sequence (v <= 1 tick/tick
limit). Rotation asymmetry (Ch6 §5) experimentally confirms this: 0% success for "forward pitch" (moving toward
present).

### Q7: What about free will and consciousness?

**A**: **Ch4 (Observer & Consciousness)** establishes observer as temporal trajectory with memory-as-indexing model. *
*Ch5 (Free Will & Ternary Logic)** presents compatibilist framework (free will = auditable agency within determinism).
Both are **highly speculative** with no experimental validation. Treat as philosophical exploration, not validated
science.

## Version History

### V2 (January 2026) - This Version

**Changes from V1**:

- Consolidated 76 chronological docs → 5 chapters + 4 references
- Removed contradictions (early vs late docs)
- Added experimental validation status to each chapter
- Created coherent narrative for new readers

**Why consolidation?**:

- V1 grew organically over time (contradictions emerged)
- New readers faced 76-document overwhelm
- Experimental validation required clear framework
- Implementation needed theoretical guidance

**Raw status**: Fully archived in `raw/` subdirectory with complete README. Nothing deleted.

### Raw (2024-2026) - Archived
