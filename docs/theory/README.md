# Foundation - Tick-Frame Physics Documentation

## Reading Order

**IMPORTANT:** These documents should be read in order of their numeric prefix (00, 01, 02, etc.).

**Conflict Resolution:** If you encounter conflicting ideas between documents, the **later document is always correct**. This reflects the iterative development process where ideas are refined and superseded by later insights.
