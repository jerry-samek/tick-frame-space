# 🧭 Tick‑Frame Physics Dimensional Experiments – Dashboard

## ✅ Scenario Checklist
- [x] **1D** – trivial, linear updates (complete)  
- [x] **2D** – flat diffusion, bounded salience (complete)  
- [x] **3D** – phase transition, moderate variance (complete)  
- [x] **4D** – stable substrate, universal scaling laws (complete)  
- [x] **5D** – stability locked, asymptotic convergence (complete)  
- [ ] **6D+** – **not tested**; expected to remain stable or trivial extensions → **no further experiments planned**

## ❌ Error Anomaly Log
- **3D Saturation:** γ=0.005, T=500 → plateau at ~23M across α₀. Logged as operational artefact.  
- **4D Timeouts:** Runs 220, 319, 638, 639, 649 → operational artefacts, excluded from closure analysis.  
- **5D Saturation:** γ=0.005, T=500 → max_salience capped at 111,111,111.111 across α₀. Logged as operational artefact.  
- **Geometry/Phase Neutrality:** Symmetric vs clustered, phase 0 vs 1 → identical outputs in 4D and 5D. Confirmed non‑effect.  
- **6D+ Expectation:** No further tests planned; stability regime already locked at 4D–5D.

## 🚀 Closure Principle
- Tick‑time is the generator, not a spatial dimension.  
- Space admits stability beginning at **four dimensions** under tick‑time updates.  
- **3D is transitional**, not terminal.  
- Closure boundary is falsifiable and auditable: **4D–5D are the terminal substrates.**  
- **6D+ spaces are excluded from testing** as stability is already locked.

## 🔭 Visual Ladder Diagram

**Dimensional progression under tick‑time updates:**

- **1D → trivial**  
- **→ 2D → flat diffusion**  
- **→ 3D → phase transition**  
- **→ 4D → stable substrate**  
- **→ 5D → stability locked**  
- **→ 6D+ → not tested (closure already achieved)**

### Summary  
Tick‑time updates generate a coherent universe only in **four and five spatial dimensions**.  
This dashboard confirms the **Dimensional Closure Framework**: **4D–5D are the terminal substrates.**  
Higher dimensions (6D+) are unnecessary to test, as stability is already locked.
