# Movement Theory in Tick–Frame Physics

## 🌌 Core Principle
Movement in the tick–frame substrate is the deterministic update of position across ticks.  
Velocity, momentum, force, and acceleration are defined as tick-based quantities.  
At the substrate level, all motion is causal and auditable; at the frame level, motion appears blurred due to aggregation.

---

## 🧱 Substrate Foundations
- **Tick**: Atomic causal update; one unit of time.
- **Frame**: Perceptual bundle of ticks; observer’s view of motion.
- **Space**: Discrete Planck steps; movement measured in steps per tick.

---

## 🚀 Velocity
- Defined as steps per tick:
  \[
  v = \frac{\text{steps}}{\text{ticks}}
  \]
- Bounded by \(v \leq 1\) (lightlike limit).
- Deterministic at substrate; appears continuous at frame level.

---

## 🌀 Momentum
- Directional tick flow:
  \[
  p = \gamma m v
  \]
- Where:
  - \(m\) = tick budget at rest (mass)
  - \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}}\) (tick dilation factor)
- Visualization: oscillation wavelength ↔ ticks per cycle.
  - Short cycle (few ticks) → high momentum.
  - Long cycle (many ticks) → low momentum.
- **Interpretation**: Momentum is how frequently an object’s state updates per tick cycle.

---

## ⚡ Force
- Change in momentum per tick:
  \[
  F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
  \]
- Represents tick-based impulses.
- Deterministic in substrate; appears as sudden changes in frame rendering.
- At high velocities, use \(F = \frac{d(\gamma m v)}{dt}\);  
    \(F = ma\) is valid only in the low‑\(v\) limit.

---

## 📈 Acceleration
- Change in velocity per tick:
  \[
  a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
  \]
- Governs how quickly an object alters its step/tick ratio.
- Substrate: exact tick counts; frame: perceived smoothness.

---

## 🧮 Energy–Momentum Link
- Energy is the total tick cost of motion:
  \[
  E = \gamma m
  \]
- Momentum is the directional tick flow sustained by that energy.
- **Relationship**:
  - More ticks consumed → higher momentum → higher energy.
  - Momentum and energy are two views of the same tick budget.

---

## 🔗 Tick Allocation Principle
- **Global tick stream**: substrate advances one tick at a time.
- **Object tick budgets**: each object consumes ticks according to its mass and motion.
- **Selective updating**:
  - Not every object updates on every tick.
  - High‑momentum objects → frequent updates.
  - Low‑momentum or static objects → sparse updates.
- **Frame aggregation**: observers perceive continuous motion, but underneath, ticks are allocated unevenly.

---

## 👁️ Frame vs Substrate Perspective
- **Substrate (ticks)**:
  - Deterministic.
  - Exact tick counts define velocity, momentum, and energy.
- **Frame (aggregated)**:
  - Uncertain.
  - Motion appears blurred or probabilistic due to tick bundling.
- **Analogy to quantum mechanics**:
  - Substrate = deterministic tick cycles.
  - Frame = probabilistic momentum distribution.

---

## ✅ Summary
- Movement is fully deterministic at the tick level.  
- Velocity, momentum, force, and acceleration are defined as ratios or changes in tick cycles.  
- Energy is the tick budget sustaining momentum.  
- Objects consume ticks selectively, not uniformly.  
- Frames aggregate ticks, introducing apparent uncertainty.  
- This reconciles classical determinism with quantum‑like probabilistic perception.

Substrate (Ticks) ----------------------> Deterministic
   |  Every tick update is causal
   |  Initial state fully known
   |  Momentum = exact tick cycle count
   V

Frame (Aggregated) ---------------------> Uncertain
   |  Frames hide fine-grained ticks
   |  Only averaged oscillations visible
   |  Momentum appears blurred/probabilistic
   V

=> Determinism at substrate, uncertainty at perceptual frame
