# 🧭 Dimensional Closure Framework

### Purpose  
To formalize the results of tick‑frame physics experiments across dimensions 1D–5D, identifying the stable substrate and proving closure boundaries.

## Findings by Dimension

- **1D – Trivial substrate**  
  - Linear updates only, no meaningful salience.  
  - Degenerate axis, not viable.

- **2D – Flat diffusion**  
  - Bounded salience, diffusion without wells.  
  - Marginal stability, transitional regime.

- **3D – Phase transition substrate**  
  - Commit behavior robust across horizons.  
  - Salience bounded except at extreme γ/T.  
  - Marks the **transition point** between instability and stability.  
  - Moderate variance (CV ≈ 5.3%).  

- **4D – Stable substrate**  
  - Salience growth converges to universal scaling laws.  
  - Lowest variance (CV ≈ 3.2%).  
  - Source independence (ρ ≈ 0.08).  
  - Geometry/phase neutrality confirmed.  
  - **Terminal stability achieved.**

- **5D – Stability locked**  
  - Same universal regime as 4D.  
  - Variance remains ≈ 3.2%, with only 0.37% drift vs 4D.  
  - Saturation artefact at γ=0.005, T=500 logged as operational, not physical.  
  - Confirms asymptotic stability.

## Closure Principle

- **Time** is the tick generator, not a spatial dimension.  
- **Space** admits stability beginning at **four dimensions** under tick‑time updates.  
- **3D is transitional**, not terminal.  
- Closure boundary is falsifiable and auditable: **4D–5D are the terminal stability substrates.**

## Next Steps

- Consolidate 4D–5D stability envelope (extreme γ/T, multi‑source interactions).  
- Extend dashboard with salience variance curves and CV/ρ metrics.  
- Formalize field propagation and dynamic rules (momentum, force, acceleration).  
- Document anomaly taxonomy (physics vs operational) for reproducibility.

**Dimensional progression under tick‑time updates:**

- **1D → trivial**  
- **→ 2D → flat diffusion**  
- **→ 3D → phase transition**  
- **→ 4D → stable substrate**  
- **→ 5D → stability locked**

### Summary  
Tick‑time updates generate a coherent universe only in **four and five spatial dimensions**.  
This framework establishes the closure boundary: **4D–5D are the terminal substrates.**
