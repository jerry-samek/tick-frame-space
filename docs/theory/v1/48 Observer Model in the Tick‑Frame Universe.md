# Observer Model in the Tick‑Frame Universe

## 1. Overview
In the tick‑frame ontology, an observer is not a static object but a *trajectory* through the tick‑stream. Identity emerges from continuity, and memory emerges from structured access to historical ticks.

This document formalizes the cognitive layer of the tick‑frame model.

## 2. Axiom 1 — Identity
**An observer is a function mapping tick n → tick n+1 within its causal region.**

Identity is not a stored entity; it is a continuous process of state propagation.

---

## 3. Axiom 2 — Existence Buffer
Each observer has an **existence buffer**, a sliding window over the tick‑stream:

- The *current tick* defines conscious presence.
- *Past ticks* within the buffer define accessible memory.
- *Future ticks* do not exist.

The size of the buffer determines:

- Memory capacity
- Stability of identity
- Temporal coherence

---

## 4. Memory as Addressing
If the buffer spans the observer’s entire lifetime:

- No memory is “stored” in the brain.
- All past tick‑states still exist in the buffer.
- The brain acts as an **indexing mechanism**, not a storage device.

**Memory = addressing historical ticks.**

This aligns with modern neuroscience: memories are reconstructions, not static files.

---

## 5. Forgetting
If the buffer is smaller than the lifetime:

- Old ticks fall out of the window.
- Memory becomes approximate rather than direct.
- Reconstruction introduces distortion and loss.

Forgetting = loss of indexability, not loss of data.

---

## 6. Trauma
A traumatic tick has:

- Extremely high signal strength
- High indexing priority
- Low activation threshold

This makes it disproportionately easy to re‑address, matching psychological observations.

---

## 7. Déjà Vu
When the current tick matches the pattern of a distant tick:

- The indexing mechanism jumps to the old tick
- Consciousness interprets this as “I have already experienced this”

Déjà vu = index collision.

---

## 8. Dreams
During sleep:

- The causal filter weakens
- Indexing becomes non‑linear
- Ticks are accessed without strict temporal order

Dreams = free traversal of the buffer.

---

## 9. Death
Death occurs when the observer can no longer generate tick n+1.

- The trajectory ends.
- The buffer remains, but no process traverses it.
- Identity ceases because continuity ceases.

---

## 10. Summary
The tick‑frame observer model provides:

- A computational definition of identity
- A physical basis for memory
- A unified explanation for forgetting, trauma, déjà vu, and dreaming
- A clean boundary condition for death

This framework integrates cognition directly into the physics of the tick‑frame universe.
