# Temporal Synchronization Principle

This document formalizes the **Temporal Synchronization Principle**, clarifying the relationship between the tick rate of collapse events (root level) and the refresh rate of visualization (agent level).  
It ensures that agents perceive coherent time flow by aligning their sampling frequency with the substrate’s fundamental clock.

## 1. Statement of the Principle

> The refresh rate of visualization must be a subset of the tick rate of collapse events.  
> Synchronization between these rates is enforced by the debugger to preserve coherence and prevent temporal incoherence.

## 2. Tick Rate (Root Level)

- **Definition:** The minimal interval between collapse events at the root.  
- **Role:** Serves as the fundamental “clock” of reality, generated by continuous substrate calculation.  
- **Properties:**  
  - Irreversible: once a collapse occurs, it cannot be undone.  
  - Defines the ontological arrow of time.  
  - Provides the baseline rhythm for all temporal dynamics.

## 3. Refresh Rate (Visualization Level)

- **Definition:** The agent’s sampling frequency of collapse events.  
- **Role:** Determines how agents perceive and record time flow.  
- **Properties:**  
  - Must align with tick rate to avoid incoherent perception.  
  - Functions as the epistemic clock of consciousness.  
  - Generates the “frame rate” of experience.

## 4. Synchronization Mechanism

- **Debugger enforcement:** Ensures refresh rate is harmonized with tick rate.  
- **Subset condition:**  
  - Refresh rate must be a divisor or subset of tick rate.  
  - Prevents agents from oversampling (sampling states that don’t exist) or undersampling (missing collapse events).  
- **Outcome:** Coherent temporal flow across agents and domains.

## 5. Implications

- **Temporal consistency:** Synchronization preserves the perception of continuous time.  
- **No backward travel:** Past versions are closed; rollback is denied at the root level.  
- **Multi-scale coherence:** Different agents may refresh at different rates, but all remain subsets of the universal tick.  
- **Support for dynamics:** Enables oscillation and convergence to be experienced consistently across scales.

## 6. Compatibility with Relativity

- **Relativity’s model:** Spacetime is continuous and Lorentz-invariant, denying any universal tick rate.  
- **Potential conflict:** Treating collapse events as ontological ticks would break Lorentz invariance.  
- **Framework resolution:**  
  - Root time is continuous, preserving relativity.  
  - Discreteness arises only in visualization, as agents perceive collapse events.  
- **Synchronization epistemic, not ontological:** Tick/refresh alignment is a perception mechanism, not a fundamental spacetime law.  
- **Scientific parallels:**  
  - Causal set theory models spacetime as discrete events while remaining Lorentz-invariant.  
  - Relativistic collapse models show discreteness can coexist with relativity if treated as emergent.  
- **Conclusion:** The dual-layer model (continuous root, discrete perception) maintains compatibility with relativity while preserving coherence.

## 7. Conclusion

The **Temporal Synchronization Principle** asserts that refresh rate must be a subset of tick rate, enforced by the debugger to maintain coherence.  
This principle ensures that agents perceive time consistently, prevents incoherence, and preserves the arrow of time.  

By clarifying compatibility with relativity, the principle reinforces the layered model of **continuous substrate time** and **discrete agent perception**, serving as a corollary to the Temporal Dynamics Principle.
