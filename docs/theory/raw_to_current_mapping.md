## Major Changes from V1 to V2

### Ontological Refinements

1. **Doc 15 → Doc 49 Evolution**
   - V1 Doc 15: Time as tick counter, space as coordinates (computational model)
   - V1 Doc 49: Time as substrate, space as emergent (ontological apex)
   - V2 Status: Ch1 uses Doc 49, Ch3 implements Doc 15 (gap documented in Ch8 §4)

2. **Dimensional Closure Clarification**
   - V1: "3D terminal" (ambiguous interpretation)
   - V2: "3D optimal, 4D-5D more stable but less balanced" (Ch2 §7-8)
   - Key: Dimensional closure = spatial only, NOT spacetime

3. **Free Will Formalization**
   - V1 Doc 24: Intuitive compatibilism
   - V2 Ch5: Formal framework with ternary logic, tick allocation, auditable agency

### Experimental Integration

4. **Experiment Validation Integrated**
   - V1: Experiments in separate directories
   - V2: Results integrated into chapters with validation status
   - 4 reference docs preserve critical experimental results

5. **Cross-Referencing Added**
   - V1: 76 independent documents (minimal cross-refs)
   - V2: 350+ cross-references between chapters
   - Clear dependency tree (Ch8 §1)

### Speculative Content Separated

6. **Deferred Topics**
   - V1 Docs 02-06, 12, 12_01, 36, 38: Mixed with validated content
   - V2: Clearly marked as "DEFERRED" or "SPECULATIVE"
   - Ch8 §3 lists all speculative components

## Usage Guide

### For Researchers

**To trace a concept**:
1. Check this mapping table for v1 doc(s) where concept originated
2. Find v2 chapter(s) where concept was incorporated
3. Read v1 doc for historical context / alternative formulations
4. Read v2 chapter for consolidated, validated version

**Example**: Tracing "temporal surfing"
- **V1 origin**: Doc 28 (Temporal Surfing Principle)
- **V2 location**: Ch3 §2 (Entity Dynamics)
- **Implementation**: Ch3 §9 (TickTimeConsumer pattern)
- **Validation**: Ch8 §2 (partial validation, over-coherence challenge)

### For Implementers

**To find Java basis**:
1. Check REFERENCE_doc15 (Minimal Model) - current implementation
2. See Ch3 for patterns (TickTimeConsumer, value classes)
3. Note gap: Doc 15 model, Doc 49 ontology (Ch8 §4)

**To add new theory**:
1. Create new v1/[next_number]_[topic].md (working notes)
2. Mark as DRAFT or SPECULATIVE
3. When validated → integrate into appropriate v2 chapter
4. Update this mapping: add row with CONSOLIDATED status

### For New Readers

**Don't start with v1** - too many documents, some contradictory

**Start with v2 README** → Reading paths for your role

**Use v1 for**:
- Historical context (how theory evolved)
- Alternative perspectives (v1 docs may frame differently)
- Detailed derivations (v2 consolidates, v1 shows steps)

---

## V1→V2 Workflow (Ongoing Development)

### Adding New Concepts

1. **Create v1 document**: `v1/[next_number]_[topic].md`
   - Low friction, explore freely
   - Mark status: DRAFT / EXPERIMENTAL / VALIDATED

2. **Validate concept**:
   - Run experiments / simulations
   - Check consistency with existing framework
   - Document results

3. **Integrate into v2**:
   - Add section to appropriate chapter
   - Update chapter changelog
   - Add row to this mapping table
   - Mark v1 doc header: "INCORPORATED → Ch[N]"

4. **Archive original**:
   - Keep v1 doc unchanged (historical record)
   - V1 remains append-only archive

### Modifying Existing Concepts

1. **Update v2 chapter** (living document)
2. **Create new v1 doc** with revision (e.g., Doc 52: "Revised X Theory")
3. **Mark old v1 doc**: "SUPERSEDED by v1/52"
4. **Update mapping table**

### Advantage

- **V1**: Low-friction notebook (append-only)
- **V2**: Polished framework (living, refined)
- **Mapping**: Full traceability maintained
