# Temporal Ontology of the Tick‑Frame Universe
A unified theoretical framework describing the nature of entities, time, space, causality, identity, and perception in a discretized temporal substrate.

---

# 1. Temporal Primacy
**Entities are fundamentally temporal processes.**  
They do not exist *in* time; they exist *as* time.

- An entity is a sequence of states across ticks.
- Identity is continuity across ticks.
- Existence is presence in the current tick.
- Time is not an external dimension but the intrinsic structure of being.

---

# 2. Tick‑Stream as Absolute Temporal Substrate
The tick‑stream is the fundamental, immutable sequence of universal states.

- It is strictly ordered: tick n → tick n+1.
- It cannot be traversed, skipped, or reversed.
- No entity can change its position in the tick‑stream.
- All physical evolution is encoded as transformations between successive ticks.

This defines the **absolute temporal axis** of the universe.

---

# 3. Existence Buffer
Entities do not access the entire tick‑stream.  
They operate within a **finite temporal buffer**:

- Current tick → conscious presence
- Past ticks within buffer → accessible memory
- Future ticks → nonexistent

The buffer is not time; it is **temporal addressability**.

---

# 4. Space as Emergent Visualization
Space is not fundamental.  
It emerges from **differences between successive ticks**.

- Spatial position = stable pattern across ticks
- Motion = systematic change between ticks
- Geometry = constraints on how patterns can evolve

Space is a *visualization* of temporal gradients.

---

# 5. Sample Rate Limit (Speed of Light)
There exists a maximum rate at which change can propagate:

- This is the **sample rate** of the universe.
- It corresponds to the speed of light.
- No physical process may evolve faster than this rate.

Exceeding this limit causes:

- breakdown of locality,
- collapse of causal order,
- non‑representable transitions.

This is a **hard physical limit**, not a perceptual one.

---

# 6. Tick Limit (Frame Generation Limit)
Tick‑rate defines how often the universe updates.

- It is the smallest temporal granularity.
- It limits how finely changes can be represented.
- It does **not** limit how fast change may propagate (that is the sample rate).

Exceeding tick‑rate causes:

- aliasing,
- missing intermediate states,
- perceptual discontinuities.

This is a **representational limit**, not a physical one.

---

# 7. Causal Readability
For the universe to remain coherent:

**Every state in tick n+1 must be derivable from tick n.**

If a process evolves faster than tick‑rate:

- intermediate states vanish,
- observer cannot reconstruct causality,
- effects may appear before causes,
- identity of objects becomes ambiguous.

This is the foundation of **causal stability**.

---

# 8. Synchrony Requirement
Stable perception requires:

\[
\text{tick‑rate}_{\text{observer}} \ge \text{tick‑rate}_{\text{observed process}}
\]

If violated:

- motion becomes discontinuous,
- spatial structure collapses locally,
- temporal order becomes ambiguous.

This is the **Sampling Synchrony Principle**.

---

# 9. Identity Continuity
Identity is not a property of objects but of trajectories.

- An entity exists only as a continuous chain of states.
- Breaking continuity breaks identity.
- Exceeding sample rate or tick‑rate can disrupt continuity.

Identity is therefore **temporal, not spatial**.

---

# 10. Temporal Aliasing
When a process evolves faster than the observer’s sampling capacity:

- intermediate states are lost,
- reconstruction becomes approximate,
- space appears distorted,
- time appears inconsistent.

Temporal aliasing is the root of:

- teleport‑like transitions,
- superposed intermediate states,
- reversed causal appearance.

---

# 11. Temporal Integrity Law
Combining all principles:

**A physically valid process must:**
1. evolve no faster than the universal sample rate,
2. be representable at the universal tick‑rate,
3. maintain causal readability between ticks,
4. preserve identity continuity across ticks.

Violation of any of these conditions results in non‑physical behavior.

---

# 12. Summary
The Temporal Ontology establishes:

- Time as the primary dimension of existence
- Entities as temporal processes
- Space as emergent visualization
- Causality as temporal consistency
- Identity as continuity
- Sample rate as the limit of physical change
- Tick‑rate as the limit of representable change
- Buffer as the scope of accessible temporal information

This ontology forms the conceptual backbone of the tick‑frame universe model.
