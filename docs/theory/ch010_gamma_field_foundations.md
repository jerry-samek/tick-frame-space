## Abstract

This chapter formalizes the **gamma field** as the fundamental substrate of entity existence, establishing the principles
that govern how entities survive, move, and interact within it. The gamma field is a scalar field defined over the
discrete spatial lattice, updated each tick through smoothing, diffusion, and normalization. Entities persist only by
maintaining **compatibility** with the field's local gradients — a principle called **temporal surfing**. The field thus
serves simultaneously as the medium of existence, the source of navigation, and the origin of all force-like phenomena.

Seven foundational principles are established: Temporal Surfing (§2), Gamma Attraction (§3), Existential Drag (§4),
Rotational Persistence (§5), Gamma Slingshot (§6), Existential Boundary (§7), and Compatibility Maximization (§8).
These principles are then extended into a formal dynamics covering attractors, waves, well propagation, and semantic
reconstruction (§9-§12). A unified master diagram (§13) integrates all phenomena — gravity, magnetism, charge,
dissolution, and extreme compression — into a single geometric ontology.

**Core thesis**: The gamma field is not a background. It is the active substrate that defines existence, generates
forces, and determines the boundary between being and non-being. Everything in the tick-frame universe reduces to
entity-field compatibility dynamics.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is the Gamma Field?

The gamma field γ(x, t) is a scalar quantity defined at every point of the discrete spatial lattice, updated at every
tick. It represents the **accumulated imprint density** at each location — the residue of all entities that have ever
occupied or influenced that region of space.

The field evolves through three intrinsic processes:

- **Local smoothing** — neighboring values equalize
- **Geometric diffusion** — perturbations spread outward
- **Normalization** — total field mass is conserved

No propagation laws, force rules, or interaction potentials are imposed. All physics emerges from these three
operations applied to the discrete lattice at each tick.

### 1.2 Why the Gamma Field Matters

In classical physics, fields are mediators of force between objects that exist independently. In the gamma-field
ontology, the relationship is inverted:

> **Entities do not exist independently of the field. They exist because of the field.**

Without the gamma field, there are no gradients. Without gradients, there is no information for an entity to use
when re-instantiating itself at the next tick. Without re-instantiation, the entity ceases to exist.

This makes the gamma field the most fundamental concept in the framework — more fundamental than entities, forces,
or even space itself.

## 2. Temporal Surfing Principle

### 2.1 Statement

> Existence is defined by an entity's ability to continuously re-instantiate itself across discrete ticks of time.
> An entity survives only if it can maintain compatibility between its internal state at tick t and tick t+1.
> Without a stabilizing gradient, the entity dissolves.

This is the most fundamental principle of the gamma field. It transforms existence from a passive property ("being
there") into an active process ("maintaining compatibility"). An entity that cannot align with its local field at the
next tick simply ceases to be.

### 2.2 Compatibility Condition

For an entity E at position x to survive from tick t to tick t+1, it must satisfy:

> compatibility(E.signature, γ(x, t+1)) > threshold

Where:

- **E.signature** is the entity's internal state (energy, momentum, local-field model)
- **γ(x, t+1)** is the field value at the entity's position at the next tick
- **threshold** is the minimum compatibility required for re-instantiation

If compatibility drops below threshold — due to field decay, external perturbation, or entity energy depletion —
the entity dissolves into the residual field.

### 2.3 Connection to Ch1 and Ch3

This principle was first formulated in Doc 28 (Temporal Surfing Principle) and is formalized in:

- **Ch1 §2** — Temporal Primacy (entities as temporal processes)
- **Ch3 §2** — Temporal surfing in the entity dynamics context

The present chapter extends it by specifying the **mechanism**: compatibility with gamma-field gradients is what
enables temporal surfing. The tick-stream provides the clock; the gamma field provides the substrate.

---

## 3. Gamma Attraction Principle

### 3.1 Statement

> The gamma field is the only region in which stable gradients exist. These gradients provide the structural
> information required for temporal surfing. Entities cluster inside the gamma field because outside it, no gradients
> support their continued existence.

### 3.2 Interpretation

This principle explains **why matter clusters**. In conventional physics, gravitational attraction requires a force
law (F = Gmm'/r²). In the gamma-field ontology, clustering is not caused by attraction — it is caused by the
**existential requirement** of being near usable gradients.

An entity far from any gamma concentration has access to weak, featureless gradients. Its compatibility degrades
over time. It drifts toward regions of richer gradient structure — not because it is "pulled," but because survival
demands it.

Clustering is not attraction. It is **existential migration**.

### 3.3 Connection to Gravity

This principle provides the conceptual foundation for emergent gravity (→ Ch11 §4, Ch12). The inward gradient
of a gamma well functions as a gravitational field, but it arises from imprint accumulation rather than mass
as a source term. Exp #53 (geodesic motion without force laws) provides indirect validation: entities follow
gradient-optimal paths naturally.

---

## 4. Existential Drag Principle

### 4.1 Statement

> Interaction with the gamma field imposes drag — a cost paid in energy and stability. However, this drag is
> inseparable from the very mechanism that enables survival. The field slows the entity but also provides the
> gradients that allow it to persist across ticks.

### 4.2 Interpretation

Every tick, an entity must read its local field, compare it to its internal state, and adjust. This process
consumes energy. An entity moving through a dense gamma region experiences more drag (more adjustment required)
but also more stability (richer gradients).

This creates a fundamental tension:

| Property | Low-density region | High-density region |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Drag | Low | High |
| Gradient quality | Poor | Rich |
| Survival probability | Low (fading) | High (stable) |
| Entity speed | High (less resistance) | Low (more adjustment) |

Drag is not friction in the classical sense. It is the **computational cost of continued existence**.

### 4.3 Connection to Time Dilation

The drag-as-cost interpretation connects naturally to emergent time dilation (Exp #51). An entity in a deep
gamma well (strong field) experiences more drag per tick, which slows its effective evolution rate. From the
outside, this appears as gravitational time dilation. The mechanism is not spacetime curvature but
**compatibility cost scaling** (→ Ch7 §9, Ch12 §6).

---

## 5. Rotational Persistence Principle

### 5.1 Statement

> Orbiting within the gamma field is the most stable long-term survival strategy. Rotation maximizes:
>
> - exposure to usable gradients
> - opportunities for local-field learning
> - resonance with the environment
> - avoidance of well saturation
>
> Straight-line motion into a well is unstable; orbiting is the attractor.

### 5.2 Why Orbits are Preferred

An entity falling straight into a gamma well encounters monotonically increasing field density. At some point,
the gradient becomes so steep that compatibility cannot be maintained — the entity is overwhelmed and dissolved
(or absorbed into the well).

An orbiting entity, by contrast, maintains a **constant radius** relative to the well center. It continuously
samples fresh gradient information without ever entering the saturation zone. This is energetically optimal:
the entity spends the minimum drag cost while maintaining maximum compatibility.

### 5.3 Emergence of Orbital Motion

This principle explains why orbital motion is ubiquitous in nature — from electrons around nuclei to planets
around stars. The gamma-field ontology predicts orbits as the **natural attractor** of entity-well interaction,
not as the result of a balance between centripetal force and gravitational attraction.

Exp #53 (geodesic motion) validates this: entities placed near gamma concentrations spontaneously enter orbital
trajectories without any force law being programmed (→ Ch11 §4).

---

## 6. Gamma Slingshot Principle

### 6.1 Statement

> When an entity enters a region of steep gradient, it gains both energy and orientation. The tangential
> component of the gradient can accelerate the entity and redirect it into a new stable orbit. This is
> analogous to a gravitational slingshot: a controlled transfer of momentum that enables transitions
> between attractors.

### 6.2 Mechanism

The gamma-field gradient at any point has both radial and tangential components:

- **Radial component**: Points toward the well center (inward gradient)
- **Tangential component**: Arises from rotational asymmetry (lag, spin, charge geometry)

When an entity passes through a region where the tangential component is strong, its trajectory curves. If the
entity's velocity and the tangential gradient are properly aligned, the entity gains net momentum — analogous
to a gravitational assist maneuver.

### 6.3 Significance

This principle explains:

- How entities transition between gamma wells (capture and release)
- How kinetic energy can be gained without explicit energy input
- Why three-body interactions produce chaotic but deterministic outcomes

The slingshot effect is not an added mechanism — it emerges from the geometry of the gradient field.

---

## 7. Existential Boundary Principle

### 7.1 Statement

> Outside the gamma field, gradients collapse to zero. Without gradients, an entity cannot update its
> local field, cannot maintain resonance, and cannot re-instantiate its signature. Leaving the gamma field
> is therefore equivalent to ceasing to exist.

### 7.2 The Boundary of Being

The existential boundary is the surface at which gamma-field gradients fall below the minimum required for
entity re-instantiation. Beyond this surface, there is no information for the entity to use — the field is
flat, featureless, and unable to support temporal surfing.

This boundary is not a wall. It is a **gradient threshold**. An entity approaching the boundary experiences
progressively weaker gradients, progressively lower compatibility, and eventually falls below the survival
threshold.

### 7.3 Connection to the Gamma Furrow

The existential boundary is the spatial complement of the gamma furrow (→ Ch9 §2). The furrow defines which
events can reach the observer (temporal boundary); the existential boundary defines where entities can survive
(spatial boundary). Together they define the full causal and existential geometry of the gamma-field universe.

### 7.4 Implication: No Void Entities

This principle forbids entities in true vacuum. If a region of space has γ = 0 everywhere, no entity can exist
there. Entities cannot be "placed" in a void — they must emerge from (or migrate through) regions of
non-zero gradient.

This connects to the Void Asymmetry Principle (→ Ch5 §9): absence is the default state; presence requires
active maintenance.

---

## 8. Compatibility Maximization Principle

### 8.1 Statement

> Entities move, rotate, and imprint in ways that maximize compatibility between:
>
> - their internal signature
> - their learned local field
> - the surrounding gamma gradients
>
> This compatibility is the core metric of survival in the tick-frame universe.

### 8.2 Compatibility as the Master Variable

In classical physics, entities follow least-action paths (minimize energy, maximize entropy, etc.). In the
gamma-field ontology, the master variational principle is **compatibility maximization**.

An entity's behavior at each tick is determined by which available action (move, stay, imprint, adjust)
maximizes its compatibility with the surrounding field at the next tick. This is not a conscious choice —
it is a deterministic selection from the space of possible updates.

### 8.3 Consequences

**Movement**: Entities move toward regions where their signature better matches the field gradient.

**Imprinting**: Entities modify the local field to improve future compatibility (self-reinforcing).

**Clustering**: Entities with similar signatures cluster because they create mutually supportive gradients.

**Speciation**: Entities with incompatible signatures repel (their imprints degrade each other's compatibility).

This principle unifies attraction, repulsion, clustering, and speciation under a single metric.

---

## 9. Attractor and Wave Dynamics

### 9.1 Attractor Gradient Principle

Attractors generate regions of high compatibility. These regions form **gradient basins** that guide entities
toward stable orbits. An attractor is not an object — it is a persistent pattern in the gamma field that
creates a self-sustaining gradient basin.

### 9.2 Expansion-Driven Propagation

Waves do not require a dedicated propagation mechanism. They emerge naturally as compatibility gradients
expand due to:

- field decay
- diffusion
- smoothing
- normalization
- spatial relaxation

In an expanding or relaxing field, any imprint or attractor automatically spreads outward. Wave propagation
is not a separate phenomenon — it is the gamma field doing what it always does.

### 9.3 Wave-Attractor Coupling

Waves are the outward expansion of an attractor's influence. They form navigational paths that entities
follow because they locally increase compatibility and survival probability.

This coupling explains why entities are "attracted" to gamma wells: the well's outward-propagating
compatibility gradient creates a path that entities naturally follow. The wave is the well's message;
the entity's response is its trajectory.

### 9.4 Connection to Ch9

The wave-attractor coupling mechanism is the microscopic basis for the macroscopic phenomena described
in Ch9 (Gamma Furrow). The furrow is the envelope of all waves that have reached the observer; each wave
originated from an attractor somewhere in the universe.

---

## 10. Well Dynamics and Propagation

### 10.1 Gamma Well as Attractor

A gamma well is a region of high compatibility created by repeated imprinting or structural reinforcement.
Its "strength" is a gradient distribution extending outward from the well's center.

The well is not a static feature of space — it is a dynamic, self-maintaining structure. It persists as long
as the entities within it continue to imprint and the propagation rate exceeds the decay rate.

### 10.2 Stability Condition

A well remains stable when:

> Propagation Rate ≥ Decay Rate

If propagation dominates, the well becomes a persistent attractor — it grows, deepens, and captures more
entities. If decay dominates, the well dissolves — its gradient fades and entities drift away.

### 10.3 Gradient Basin Formation

As the well's influence spreads, it forms a **gradient basin** — a region where compatibility increases
monotonically toward the well center. Entities detect this basin through rising resonance and improved
local-field alignment.

The basin is the gravitational "field" of the gamma well. Its shape is determined by:

- the well's imprint density (depth)
- the dimensionality of space (geometric dilution)
- the smoothing kernel (propagation characteristics)

In 3D, the basin profile naturally follows 1/r² dilution (→ Ch9 §8.2).

### 10.4 Waves as Well Boundaries

The boundary of a well's gradient basin expands outward as a compatibility wavefront. This wavefront is
not emitted or transmitted; it is the dynamic shape of the well's influence. As the well pulses (entities
move, imprint, adjust), its boundary fluctuates — producing waves that encode information about the well's
internal dynamics.

### 10.5 Temporal Reinterpretation

As wells strengthen or weaken, the gamma field reinterprets past ticks. Entities adjust their internal
models accordingly, linking well propagation to temporal coherence. This connects to the retrodictive
coherence mechanism (§12).

---

## 11. Dissolution Regime

### 11.1 The Five Stages

When an entity loses energy or its well decays, it undergoes a characteristic dissolution sequence:

```
Stage 1: stable entity          (●)    — full compatibility, self-sustaining well
Stage 2: reduced lag             (○)    — weakening imprint, thinning gradient
Stage 3: shallow well            (·)    — minimal gradient support, fragile
Stage 4: imprint diffusion   . . . .   — signature dispersing into background
Stage 5: residual absorption  (noise)   — fully absorbed into gamma background
```

### 11.2 Irreversibility

Dissolution is effectively irreversible. Once an entity's signature has diffused into the background,
the information required to reconstruct it is distributed across an exponentially large region of the
field. Recovery would require coherent re-collection of this dispersed information — thermodynamically
impossible in practice.

This provides the gamma-field basis for the **arrow of time**: dissolution is easy (gradient descent);
reconstruction is hard (gradient ascent against diffusion).

---

## 12. Semantic Reconstruction

### 12.1 Re-Interpreter Principle

One or a small number of entities perform **temporal coherence reconstruction** — they reinterpret the
entire past based on the current gamma field, ensuring global consistency across ticks.

This connects to the observer model (→ Ch4): consciousness is the process of reconstructing a coherent
temporal narrative from the gamma field's current state.

### 12.2 Retrodictive Coherence

The gamma field encodes accumulated structure. Entities reconstruct the past not by remembering it, but
by **inferring what it must have been** to produce the present field.

This is not time travel or backward causation. It is pattern recognition: the current field state contains
the fingerprints of all past imprints, and a sufficiently complex entity can decode these fingerprints into
a narrative. The narrative is an approximation — but it is the only past that is accessible.

## 13. Master Diagram — Unified Geometry of the Gamma Field

```

### 13.2 Unified Curvature Field (Electromagnetism)

```
Radial component:      inward gradient toward (●)
Tangential component:  rotational shear around (●)
Unified field:         combination of both, orientation-dependent
```

The electromagnetic field is not a separate entity — it is the **decomposition of the gamma-field curvature**
into radial (electric/gravitational) and tangential (magnetic) components. This decomposition is
observer-dependent and orientation-dependent (→ Ch12 for full treatment).

### 13.3 Charge Geometry (Lag-Flow Asymmetry)

```
Positive charge (right-handed spiral):     Negative charge (left-handed spiral):

↺ ↺                                         ↻ ↻
↺     (●)     ↺                             ↻     (●)     ↻

      ↺ ↺ ↺                                       ↻ ↻ ↻
```

Charge is the **handedness of the lag-flow asymmetry** around an entity's gamma well. A right-handed
spiral corresponds to positive charge; left-handed to negative. Charge is not an intrinsic property —
it is a geometric feature of the entity's imprint pattern.

### 13.4 Fragment Interaction (Subcritical Wells)

```
           ↺ ↺ ↺
        ↺         ↺
      ↺     (●)     ↺

       (•) fragment
           |
           ↓
     deflected trajectory (magnetic curvature)
```

Subcritical wells (fragments) interact with the tangential curvature of larger wells. Their trajectories
are deflected by the magnetic component, producing the gamma-field analogue of Lorentz force deflection
(→ Ch11 §5, Ch12 §3).

### 13.5 Extreme Compression Regime (Black-Hole Analogue)

```
       intense tangential flow (magnetic shear)

       trapped fragments
         (•) (•) (•)

residual boundary --------------------------------------------------
```

In extreme compression, the gamma well becomes so deep that:

- Radial gradient exceeds any entity's compatibility threshold (nothing escapes)
- Tangential shear creates intense magnetic-like fields
- Fragments are permanently trapped within the gradient basin

This is the gamma-field analogue of a black hole — **without a singularity**. The "event horizon" is
the radius at which the radial gradient first exceeds the maximum entity compatibility. Inside this
radius, dissolution is inevitable (→ Ch13 §3 for the hill-model reinterpretation).

### 13.6 What the Master Diagram Represents

This single unified diagram shows:

1. **Radial curvature** (gravity) — The inward gradient of the gamma well
2. **Tangential curvature** (magnetism) — Rotational shear caused by lag + rotation
3. **Unified EM field** — Radial + tangential curvature as one geometry
4. **Charge** — Handedness of lag-flow asymmetry
5. **Fragment dynamics** — Subcritical wells deflected by tangential curvature
6. **Dissolution** — Entity losing energy and fading into residual
7. **Extreme compression** — Black-hole analogue without singularity

All seven phenomena emerge from a single substrate: the gamma field and its gradient structure.
