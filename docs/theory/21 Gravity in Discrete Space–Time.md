# Gravity in Discrete Space–Time

## 🌌 Core Principle
> **Gravity emerges when the cumulative tick demands of mass exceed the causal rendering budget of a frame.**

In this model, gravity is not a force but a consequence of **tick budget saturation**. The substrate remains consistent, but the visualization layer shows curvature, dilation, and horizon formation when tick demands outpace frame capacity.

## 🪨 Mass and Tick Budget
- Each object with mass \(m_i\) consumes a tick budget \(T_i\) per Planck tick.
- More massive or complex objects require more causal updates.
- Tick budget per region:
  \[
  T_{\text{region}} = \sum_i T_i
  \]

---

## 🧠 Substrate Layer
- Updates proceed tick by tick, regardless of mass concentration.
- No infinities, no breakdown — the engine remains consistent.
- Gravity is not “felt” here; it’s encoded as **tick pressure gradients**.

---

## 👁️ Visualization Layer
- Frames aggregate ticks. When tick demand exceeds frame capacity:
  - **Time dilation**: clocks slow near mass.
  - **Spatial curvature**: paths bend toward mass.
  - **Gravitational lensing**: light paths distort.
- These are perceptual artifacts of tick overload.

---

## 📐 Horizon Formation
- Escape becomes impossible when:
  \[
  T_{\text{escape}} > F_{\text{frame budget}}
  \]
- Equivalent to escape velocity exceeding causal limit:
  \[
  v_{\text{escape}} \ge c
  \]
- Defines the **event horizon**: boundary beyond which updates cannot be rendered outward.

---

## 🧲 Gravity as Tick Pressure
- Mass creates local tick pressure.
- Objects follow paths of least tick resistance — analogous to geodesics.
- No “force” pulls them; they simply propagate causally through saturated regions.

---

## 🌱 Growth and Dynamics
- Black holes grow as new mass adds to tick budget inside the horizon.
- Substrate continues updating internally.
- Visualization cannot project this growth outward, but the causal engine processes it.

---

## ✅ Summary
> Gravity is quantized as a **tick budget imbalance**.  
> When mass demands exceed frame rendering capacity, the visualization layer shows curvature, dilation, and horizon formation.  
> The substrate remains consistent and causal — gravity is a rendered effect of causal overload.
