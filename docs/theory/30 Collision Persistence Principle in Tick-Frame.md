# Collision Persistence Principle

**Definition**  
Particles are not static entities but **patterns of collisions** that sustain themselves across ticks.  
Their existence is defined by continuous interaction — energy exchange, momentum transfer, reproduction, and decay.  
A particle persists only insofar as collisions keep renewing its structure.

## Core Ideas
- **No identity without interaction**  
  A particle is the continuity of collisions, not an isolated object.
- **Persistence = renewal**  
  To remain within the tick‑frame horizon, collisions must continually re‑instantiate the entity’s pattern.
- **Death = silence**  
  When collisions cease, energy disperses back into the substrate, and the particle dissolves.
- **Emergence from substrate**  
  Blobs are condensations of energy fields; collisions are the mechanism by which they gain apparent individuality.

## Implications for the Universe
- **Memory stability**  
  Entities don’t need to be heap objects; they can be projections of collision patterns in the substrate.
- **Renderer honesty**  
  What you visualize as “particles” are really snapshots of ongoing collisions.
- **Cosmological narrative**  
  Extinction events (like OOM) mark the point where collisions saturate and can no longer renew patterns.

## Philosophical Echo
This principle ties into the **Temporal Surfing Principle**:  
Surfing time requires collisions; without them, the wave collapses.  
Existence is defined not by static identity, but by the **neverending collision**.
