# Mass in Discrete Space–Time

## 🪨 Definition
- **Mass = rest-energy budget per tick.**
- It represents the causal cost of existence in the substrate, even when no spatial steps are taken.
- In natural units (\(c=1\)):
  \[
  E_{\text{rest}} = m
  \]

---

## ⚙️ Discrete Formalization
- Each tick, an object of mass \(m\) consumes \(m\) units of rest-energy budget.
- If the object moves:
  - Velocity:
    \[
    v = \frac{n_{\text{steps}}}{n_{\text{ticks}}}
    \]
  - Lorentz factor:
    \[
    \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2}}
    \]
  - Total energy:
    \[
    E = \gamma m
    \]

## 📐 Derived Quantities
- **Momentum:**
  \[
  p = \gamma m v
  \]
- **Force:**
  \[
  F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
  \]
- **Acceleration:**
  \[
  a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}, \quad F = m a
  \]

## ✅ Summary
- Mass anchors dynamics in discrete space–time.  
- It defines the rest-energy budget per tick, makes momentum and force meaningful, and determines how many ticks are required to change velocity.  
- More massive or complex objects consume more tick budget per unit time, reflecting inertia.
