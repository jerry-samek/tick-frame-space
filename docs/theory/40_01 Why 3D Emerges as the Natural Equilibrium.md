## Why 3D Emerges as the Natural Equilibrium

Although higher dimensions are mathematically possible, they introduce excessive freedom: with more axes, almost any latency structure can be embedded, which dissolves constraint and undermines falsifiability. Lower dimensions, on the other hand, collapse causal richness:

- **1D**: All interactions lie on a line, too restrictive to sustain complex persistence.
- **2D**: Surfaces allow more variation, but fail to capture volumetric causality and stable horizons.
- **3D**: The first dimension that balances order and freedom — rich enough to support volumes, cones, and gradients, yet constrained enough to remain auditable and stable.
- **4D+**: Consistent embeddings are always possible, but the surplus of degrees of freedom prevents meaningful structure; chaos is “smoothed away” too much.

**Key Insight:**  
Three dimensions emerge as the natural equilibrium point — the minimal non‑trivial space where persistence, causality, and constraint coexist. Higher dimensions are allowed, but they dilute structure; lower dimensions are too restrictive. 3D is the sweet spot between collapse and over‑freedom.
