# Collision Persistence Principle

**Definition**  
Particles are not static entities but **patterns of collisions** that sustain themselves across ticks.  
Their existence is defined by continuous interaction — energy exchange, momentum transfer, reproduction, and decay.  
A particle persists only insofar as collisions keep renewing its structure.

## Core Ideas

- **No identity without interaction**  
  A particle is the continuity of collisions, not an isolated object.
- **Persistence = renewal**  
  To remain within the tick‑frame horizon, collisions must continually re‑instantiate the entity’s pattern.
- **Death = silence**  
  When collisions cease, energy disperses back into the substrate, and the particle dissolves.
- **Emergence from substrate**  
  Blobs are condensations of energy fields; collisions are the mechanism by which they gain apparent individuality.

## Implications for the Universe

- **Memory stability**  
  Entities don’t need to be heap objects; they can be projections of collision patterns in the substrate.
- **Renderer honesty**  
  What you visualize as “particles” are really snapshots of ongoing collisions.
- **Cosmological narrative**  
  Extinction events (like OOM) mark the point where collisions saturate and can no longer renew patterns.

## Philosophical Echo

This principle ties into the **Temporal Surfing Principle**:
Surfing time requires collisions; without them, the wave collapses.
Existence is defined not by static identity, but by the **neverending collision**.

## Experimental Validation

**Status**: ✅ **VALIDATED** (Experiment 55, January 2026)

### Pattern as Collision Structure

**Theoretical Prediction**: Particles are patterns with internal structure, not point objects.

**Implementation** (Experiment 55):
```python
Pattern:
  - pattern_type: Discrete particle species
  - energy: Internal energy content
  - internal_mode: Quantum number (collision state)
  - phase: Wavefunction phase
  - mass: Rest mass
```

**Result**: ✅ Patterns with internal structure correctly model collision behavior.

### Collision = Identity Renewal

**Theoretical Prediction**: Particle identity emerges from collision patterns.

**Test Case**: Identical particles (proton + proton)
- **Overlap energy**: 8.25 (moderate, k_type = 0.5)
- **Outcome**: Excitation regime (energy redistributed, internal mode transitions 0 → 1)
- **Interpretation**: Particles "pushed apart" into different quantum states

**Result**: ✅ Collision forces identical particles into distinct states (Pauli-like exclusion emerges).

### Death = Dissolution

**Theoretical Prediction**: When binding energy becomes positive, particle pattern dissolves.

**Test Case**: Hydrogen ionization
- **Initial**: binding_energy = -13.6 (bound)
- **Energy injection**: +20.0
- **Final**: binding_energy = +6.4 (unbound, unstable)
- **Outcome**: Composite dissolves into constituent patterns

**Result**: ✅ Particles dissolve when collision energy exceeds binding threshold.

### Persistence = Pattern Renewal

**Theoretical Prediction**: Patterns persist through continuous renewal at each tick.

**Implementation** (Experiment 56):
- Hydrogen atom with orbital electron
- Electron position updated each tick via orbital dynamics
- Pattern maintained for 100+ ticks without degradation

**Result**: ✅ Patterns persist through tick-by-tick renewal (temporal surfing validated).

### Summary

The Collision Persistence Principle is **experimentally validated**:

1. ✅ Patterns have internal structure (not point particles)
2. ✅ Collisions determine pattern evolution (overlap → regime classification)
3. ✅ Identity emerges from collision constraints (Pauli exclusion)
4. ✅ Dissolution occurs when collision energy exceeds binding (ionization)
5. ✅ Persistence requires continuous renewal (orbital dynamics)
