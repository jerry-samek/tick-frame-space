# Tick‑Frame Universe: Physical Formalization

## 1. Overview

The tick‑frame universe is a discrete physical model in which reality is represented as a sequence of atomic temporal
states called *ticks*. Time emerges from the ordering of ticks, and space emerges from the relational structure encoded
within each tick.

This framework provides a computationally grounded ontology of physics, identity, and causality.

---

## 2. Axiom 1 — Existence

**To exist means to be present in the current tick.**  
Anything not represented in the active tick is not part of reality.

---

## 3. Axiom 2 — Causality

**Tick n+1 is a deterministic transformation of tick n within a local causal region.**

- Causality is strictly local.
- No information can propagate faster than one spatial unit per tick.
- This naturally yields the speed of light as the maximum propagation rate.

---

## 4. Axiom 3 — Granularity

The tick‑frame model adopts Planck‑scale discretization:

- **1 tick = 1 Planck time**
- **1 spatial unit = 1 Planck length**
- Light travels exactly one spatial unit per tick (“speed‑of‑light sampler”).

This defines the smallest possible resolution of physical change.

## 5. Derived Quantity — Number of Ticks in the Universe

Given:

- Age of the universe:  
  \( t_U \approx 4.3 \times 10^{17} \, \text{s} \)
- Planck time:  
  \( t_P \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-44} \, \text{s} \)

Number of ticks since the Big Bang:

\[
N_{\text{universe}} = \frac{t_U}{t_P} \approx 10^{61}
\]

---

## 6. Derived Quantity — Ticks for a Human Lifetime

For a 100‑year observer:

\[
N_{\text{obs}} = \frac{3 \times 10^{9} \, \text{s}}{5.4 \times 10^{-44}} \approx 10^{53}
\]

---

## 7. Derived Quantity — Computational Cost of Existence

Let:

- \( C \) = number of operations required to update an observer per tick

Total operations over a lifetime:

\[
O_{\text{total}} = N_{\text{obs}} \cdot C
\]

Real‑time computational throughput:

\[
P = \frac{O_{\text{total}}}{T_{\text{obs}}}
\approx 3 \times 10^{43} \cdot C \, \text{ops/s}
\]

Typical ranges:

- Minimal observer: \( C \approx 10^{6} \Rightarrow P \approx 10^{49} \, \text{ops/s} \)
- Rich observer: \( C \approx 10^{12} \Rightarrow P \approx 10^{55} \, \text{ops/s} \)

This defines the theoretical upper bound for simulating a single observer at Planck resolution.

---

## 8. Comparison — Planetary Computational Capacity

To contextualize the theoretical requirements:

- Global supercomputers peak around \(10^{18}\) ops/s.
- Including all GPUs, CPUs, mobile devices, and embedded systems, an extremely optimistic estimate yields:

\[
P_{\text{Earth}} \approx 10^{22} \, \text{ops/s}
\]

Comparison with the required throughput:

- Against the minimal observer requirement (\(10^{49}\) ops/s):

  \[
  \frac{P_{\text{Earth}}}{10^{49}} \approx 10^{-27}
  \]

- Against the rich observer requirement (\(10^{55}\) ops/s):

  \[
  \frac{P_{\text{Earth}}}{10^{55}} \approx 10^{-33}
  \]

**Interpretation:**  
Even if all computational devices on Earth were combined, humanity operates at roughly  
**\(10^{-27}\) to \(10^{-33}\)** of the performance required to simulate a single Planck‑granular observer in real time.

This gap illustrates the physical extremity of Planck‑scale simulation and reinforces the necessity of compression,
coarse‑graining, and emergent dynamics in any practical engine.

---

## 9. Interpretation

The tick‑frame universe provides:

- A discrete temporal substrate (tick‑stream)
- Local deterministic causality
- Emergent spatial structure
- A computable definition of existence
- A measurable upper bound on the cost of simulating reality
- A clear comparison to planetary computational limits

This model bridges physics and computation in a unified formalism.
