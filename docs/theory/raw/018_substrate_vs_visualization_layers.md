# Substrate vs Visualization Layers

| Aspect                   | Substrate Layer (Tick-Level Reality)                         | Visualization Layer (Frame-Level Perception)                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Update Budget**        | One Planck tick per causal update; sequential, consistent    | Many ticks aggregated into one frame; coarse sampling                              |
| **Causality**            | Strictly enforced: \(v \le c\); no skipping, no infinity     | Apparent violations possible if measuring only at frame granularity                |
| **Velocity**             | Defined as steps per ticks; always finite and bounded        | Apparent velocity can be underestimated or distorted                               |
| **Energy**               | Finite, computed via Lorentz factor from tick-based velocity | Can appear divergent (e.g., infinite at \(v=c\)) if only frame-level is considered |
| **Distance**             | Number of Planck steps traversed; invariant at tick level    | May appear contracted if intermediate positions are skipped                        |
| **Time**                 | Count of ticks elapsed; universal causal budget              | Rendered as frame duration; can show time dilation effects                         |
| **Relativistic Effects** | None at substrate (causal invariants preserved)              | Emergent artifacts: time dilation, length contraction, infinite energy             |
| **Role**                 | Fundamental causal substrate; true physics                   | Perceptual layer; visualization of substrate evolution                             |

## ✅ Key Insight

- **Substrate layer:** Always finite, causal, and consistent.
- **Visualization layer:** Can *appear* paradoxical (infinite energy, dilation, contraction) due to coarse aggregation.
- This mirrors relativity: the underlying causal structure is invariant, but observers in different frames perceive
  distortions.

---

## 🌌 Dimensional Neutrality

- The visualization layer is **dimension-agnostic**.
- Whether objects occupy 3D, 4D, or 5D coordinates, the frame still bundles ticks into perceptual snapshots.
- **Multi-dimensional objects remain consistent:**
    - Substrate enforces tick-by-tick causality across all dimensions.
    - Visualization aggregates those ticks without collapsing or diverging.
- **Locked dynamics in 4D–5D:** Because higher dimensions show minimal variance and source/geometry independence, the
  visualization outputs are cleaner and more stable than in 3D.
- **Artefacts remain the same:** Time dilation, length contraction, and saturation caps are still frame-level
  distortions, not substrate failures.

---

## 🔗 Consistency Bridge

- **Substrate → Visualization:** The substrate enforces causality; the visualization layer interprets aggregates.
- Multi-dimensionality changes the richness of substrate states but not the visualization mechanism.
- The visualization layer continues to show relativistic artefacts, but now fed by a more stable substrate in 4D–5D.

---

## ✅ Summary

- The substrate is deterministic and causal, regardless of dimensionality.
- The visualization layer is a perceptual renderer, dimension-neutral, and prone to artefacts from coarse sampling.
- Moving from 3D to 4D–5D objects does not invalidate the visualization layer — it simply makes the outputs more stable
  and universal.
- **Key closure:** The visualization layer remains consistent even as the substrate expands to multi-dimensional objects
  along the tick timeline.
