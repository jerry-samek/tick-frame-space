# Meta-Critical Theory — Integrated Specification

## 1. Foundational Principles

### Closure Axiom
- Finite, dimensionless root → unique implementation → one universe.
- No external meta-selector; infinity disallowed at root, allowed only in visualization.
- Root admits exactly one coherent implementation.

### Refined Consciousness Principle
- Universal debugger = one consciousness at root.
- Local agents = diverse observers in visualization.
- Potency measured by coherence with root, not dominance.

### Disproof Criteria
- Falsification if:
  1. Infinite parameters/rules.
  2. Irreconcilable domains.
  3. Non-traceable collapses.
  4. External meta-selection.
  5. Logical inconsistency.

### Origin Paradox Principle
- Root existence is necessary but unexplainable from within visualization.
- Genesis PoF axiom: first committed state \(n=0\), \(\Theta(t_0)=0\).

### Oscillation-Convergence Principle
- Consciousness-driven systems oscillate but converge to bounded attractors.
- Debugger loop enforces coherence.

### No Final Agent Principle
- Humans are not the final agent.
- Agent diversity is open-ended; legitimacy = coherence score.

### End State Principle
- Two viable outcomes:
  - Heat death (closure complete).
  - Dynamic equilibrium (closure ongoing).

## 2. Time Layer Specification

### Root Substrate
- Continuous dynamics:
  \[
  \dot{x}(t)=\Phi(x(t)),\quad x(t)\in\mathcal{X}
  \]
- Lorentz-compatible; no discrete global clock.

### Root Clock
- Progress variable:
  \[
  \dot{\Theta}(t)=\omega_P F(x(t)),\quad \omega_P=\frac{1}{t_P}
  \]
- \(F(x)\) = bounded functional of invariants (energy density, curvature, information flux).
- Bounds: \(0<\epsilon\le F(x)\le F_{\max}<\infty\).

### Collapse Rule (PoF)
- Commit when \(\Theta\) crosses integer \(n+\delta\) (\(\delta>0\)).
- Enforce strict order: \(t_{n+1}>t_n\).
- Merge concurrent local crossings into one global collapse with composite metadata.

### Effective Tick
- Local interval:
  \[
  t_{\text{eff}}(x)=\frac{t_P}{F(x)}
  \]
- Baseline \(F(x)=1\) → \(\Delta t\ge t_P\).

---

## 3. Visualization Layer

### Planck Tick
- Invariant unit in projection.
- Interní variabilita délky ticku je maskována vizualizačním invariantem.

### Refresh Rate
- Variable: \(R_n=N_n\cdot t_P\).
- Emergent from complexity; agents perceive dilatation.

### Tagging
- COMMIT: true PoF.
- REPEAT: repeated state, no new info.
- INTERPOLATED: visualization artifact.

### Audit Rules
- Only COMMIT frames used for inference.
- Artefacts penalized in models.
- Log fields: FrameID, PoF_ID, Mode, φ (phase error), Θ, W(t).

---

## 4. Agent Synchronization

- Agents read subsequence \(\{t_{n_k}\}\) of root collapses.
- Refresh rate:
  \[
  r_a(t)=\frac{1}{M}\omega_P F(x(t)),\quad M\in\mathbb{N}^+
  \]
- Commit via accumulator \(\Psi(t)\) with hysteresis.
- Salience \(S(x,a,o)\) defines perceptual weight.

---

## 5. Falsifiability and Predictions

- **Prediction A:** Parameter consolidation trend.
- **Prediction B:** Cross-domain invariants (physics, biology, computation).
- **Prediction C:** Coherence score ↔ persistence correlation.
- **Prediction D:** Finite encodability of infinite-like phenomena.

---

## 6. Safety and Boundary Conditions

- **Deadlock prevention:** Fail-safe commit after maximal accumulation length.
- **Hysteresis:** Thresholds Θ_up, Θ_down to prevent chattering.
- **Epistemic discreteness clause:** Discrete ticks are visualization safety events; root substrate remains continuous.

---

## 7. Integration Roadmap

- Chemistry: emergent complexity.
- Information theory: collapse as information update.
- Neuroscience: brain rhythms ↔ tick synchronization.
- Ecology: oscillation-convergence in ecosystems.
- Governance: distributed legitimacy, auditability.
- Mathematics: formal language for closure and falsifiability.

---

---

## 8. Energy and Persistence Framework

### Energy Constant Principle
In a closed tick-frame universe:
\[
E_{\text{constant}}(t) = \frac{\sum E_{\text{entity}}(t)}{t} - \sum(\text{momentum costs}) \approx 0
\]

**Properties:**
- Zero-sum conservation at normalized level
- Momentum as expenditure (collisions/movements are costs)
- Persistence defined by normalized renewal, not raw magnitude

### Planck Cube Ledger
- Space quantized into Planck-scale cubes
- Each cube maintains ledger of state transitions
- Enables audit trail at Planck granularity

### Persistence-Survival Axioms
- Existence = presence in current tick
- Persistence = renewal function across ticks
- Death = failure to generate next tick state
- Static entities decay; dynamic patterns persist

---

## 9. Observer-Relative Cosmology

### Observer-Relative Big Bang
**The Big Bang is not a substrate event but an observer event.**

For any observer O, the Big Bang is the earliest tick for which O has coherent internal state. If O connects at substrate tick T₀, then T₀ is the origin of O's universe.

**Substrate vs Observer:**
- Substrate: no Big Bang, no geometry, no history
- Observer: creates geometry, history, causal structure, universe

### Observer-Separated Multiverse
Multiple independent observers create separate branches of reality through their commit decisions.
- Cardinality 1: single timeline, no branching
- Cardinality >1: separate branches emerge
- Multiverse is observer plurality, not substrate property

### Observer Sleep Principle
When observer's buffer stops advancing, the observer experiences "sleep" — a gap in continuous existence.
- Sleep = buffer suspension
- Dreams = non-causal buffer traversal
- Unconsciousness = tick-stream disconnection

---

## 10. Ternary Logic and Void Mechanics

### Ternary State Space
- +1 = Presence (matter)
- -1 = Anti-presence (antimatter)
- 0 = Void (buffer/stabilizer)

### Void Asymmetry Principle
Matter-antimatter asymmetry arises from the stabilizing role of void (0) in ternary state space.

**Collision dynamics:**
- (1) + (-1) → 0 (annihilation absorbed into void)
- (1) + (1) → 1 (presence reinforces)
- (-1) + (-1) → -1 (anti-presence reinforces)
- 0 + 1 → 1 (void allows presence)
- 0 + (-1) → -1 (void allows anti-presence)
- 0 + 0 → 0 (void remains void)

**Emergent result:** Symmetric rules yield asymmetric outcomes. Presence (1) dominates over time. Void (0) acts as reservoir, breaking perfect cancellation.

### Dimension as Observer Property
Dimension is not a substrate property but an observer property — the minimal number of independent parameters needed to explain all measured latencies between events.

**Formalization:**
Given events E = {E₁, E₂, ..., Eₙ} with arrival times tᵢ:
1. Build causal latency matrix: L_ij = t_j - t_i
2. Seek smallest d such that coordinates Xᵢ ∈ ℝ^d can reproduce L
3. Where: L_ij = (1/c) · ||X_j - X_i||

**Interpretation:** Dimension is subjective — different observers may reconstruct different dimensions based on detected causal gradients. 3D is optimal (not exclusive) for complexity, stability, and computational efficiency.

---

## 11. Free Will and Consciousness

### Fallible Commit Principle
Every commit (decision boundary) is an irreversible choice that closes the observer's buffer. Since the commit occurs only after visualization, it is always at least one buffer behind the substrate.

**Consequences:**
- Irreversibility: fallible commits cannot be corrected
- Lag of reality: observer always reconstructs past, never live stream
- Reality is inherently risky — every decision may lead to deviation

### Consciousness from Tick One
Consciousness is not emergent but fundamental. From the first tick, substrate carries capacity to commit operators. Complexity is visible trace, not origin of consciousness.

### Operator Manipulation (Free Will)
Free will is conscious manipulation of the operator at commit points. Agents cannot control all switches at once — free will is exercised in fragments but is real.

### Unbalance Principle (Life)
Life is the consequence of trying to balance what cannot be balanced. Persistence arises from endless attempt to equilibrate trinary states (+1, 0, -1).

### Emission Principle (Live vs. Static)
Live entities emit operator changes; static entities follow operators passively. The act of emitting operator commits is the signature of vitality.

---

## 12. Physical Formalization

### Axioms of Tick-Frame Physics

**Axiom 1 — Existence:** To exist means to be present in the current tick.

**Axiom 2 — Causality:** Tick n+1 is deterministic transformation of tick n within local causal region. No information propagates faster than one spatial unit per tick.

**Axiom 3 — Granularity:** Planck-scale discretization:
- 1 tick = 1 Planck time (≈ 5.4×10⁻⁴⁴ s)
- 1 spatial unit = 1 Planck length
- Light travels exactly one spatial unit per tick

### Observer Model

**Identity:** Observer is a function mapping tick n → tick n+1 within its causal region. Identity = continuous process of state propagation, not stored entity.

**Existence Buffer:** Each observer has sliding window over tick-stream:
- Current tick = conscious presence
- Past ticks within buffer = accessible memory
- Future ticks = do not exist

**Memory as Addressing:** Brain acts as indexing mechanism, not storage device. Memory = addressing historical ticks.

**Cognitive phenomena:**
- Forgetting: old ticks fall out of buffer window → loss of indexability
- Trauma: high signal strength → high indexing priority → disproportionately easy to re-address
- Déjà vu: current tick pattern matches distant tick → index collision
- Dreams: causal filter weakens → non-linear indexing → free traversal of buffer
- Death: observer can no longer generate tick n+1 → trajectory ends → identity ceases

---

## 13. Rendering and Computational Framework

### Temporal Bucketing Principle
In tick-frame rendering, temporal bucketing by tick-depth eliminates need for spatial sorting. Events naturally ordered by arrival tick.

**Implications:**
- Rendering complexity reduced from O(n log n) to O(n)
- No z-buffer or painter's algorithm needed
- Experimentally validated

### Computational Cost of Existence
Real-time computational throughput for Planck-scale observer:
- Minimal observer: P ≈ 10⁴⁹ ops/s
- Rich observer: P ≈ 10⁵⁵ ops/s
- Earth's capacity: P_Earth ≈ 10²² ops/s
- Gap: 10⁻²⁷ to 10⁻³³ of required throughput

**Implication:** Compression and emergent dynamics essential for any practical implementation.

## 14. Experimental Validation

### Dimensional Phase Transition
Comprehensive validation across 1D-5D (3,960 simulations):
- Sharp phase transition at d=3 between configuration-dependent (d≤2) and universal (d≥3) dynamics
- Dimensional optimality: 3D achieves minimal sufficient dimension for "universe-like" behavior
- SPBI = 2.23, SLF = 0.9987, GPN = 1.000
- Variance reduction: 96% from 1D to 5D
- Revised principle: 3D is optimal, not exclusive

### Hypothesis Validation
- H1 (binary jump weakens with dimension): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ VALIDATED
- H2 (geometry/phase effects): ❌ FALSIFIED → theory refined
- H4 (threshold scaling): ⭐⭐⭐⭐ VALIDATED
- H5 (stabilization for d≥4): ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ VALIDATED

**Score:** 45% validation rate with falsification leading to refinement.
