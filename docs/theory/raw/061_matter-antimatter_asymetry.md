# Matter–Antimatter Asymmetry in Tick‑Frame Physics
**Document 0XX — Pattern‑Matching Requirement for Annihilation**  
**Status:** Draft 1  
**Author:** Tom  
**Purpose:** Explain why matter and antimatter did not globally annihilate in the early universe within the tick‑frame ontology.

## 1. Introduction

In conventional cosmology, the **baryon asymmetry problem** asks why the early universe did not end in complete matter–antimatter annihilation. If matter and antimatter were created in equal amounts, they should have mutually eliminated each other, leaving only radiation.

Tick‑frame physics provides a fundamentally different answer.  
In this ontology, annihilation is **not** a guaranteed outcome of matter–antimatter encounters. Instead, it is a **special case** requiring precise alignment of internal pattern structure.

This document formalizes that idea.

## 2. Particles as Patterns

In the tick‑frame model, particles are not point‑like objects.  
They are **atomic patterns** stored in single cells, defined by:

- **pattern type** (species)
- **energy**
- **internal mode** (quantum number)
- **phase** (0–2π)
- **mass**
- **temporal renewal behavior**

Two particles “meeting” in the same cell does not automatically imply annihilation.  
Instead, the collision outcome depends on **pattern overlap**, a multi‑dimensional compatibility measure.

## 3. Annihilation as a Pattern‑Matching Event

Matter–antimatter annihilation corresponds to **Regime 3.2 (Explosion)** in the collision framework:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B + E_{\text{overlap}}
\]

Annihilation occurs only when:

1. **Pattern types are complementary** (matter vs antimatter)
2. **Internal modes align**
3. **Phases align**
4. **Energies fall within the destructive overlap window**
5. **Both patterns occupy the same cell in the same tick**

Only under these conditions does the overlap energy become maximal:

\[
E_{\text{overlap}} \approx E_{\text{base}}
\]

leading to:

- destruction of both patterns,
- photon production,
- shockwave propagation.

This is a **fine‑tuned configuration**, not the default.

## 4. Why Global Annihilation Did Not Occur

For complete annihilation of all matter and antimatter in the early universe, the following would need to be true:

- Every matter pattern must find a **perfectly matched** antimatter pattern.
- They must meet in the **same cell**.
- In the **same tick**.
- With **matching phase**, **matching mode**, and **compatible energy**.
- Before any other interaction (fusion, excitation, scattering) alters either pattern.

This is an extremely restrictive condition.

### 4.1 Pattern Mismatch Prevents Annihilation

If any of the following differ:

- phase
- internal mode
- energy
- pattern subtype
- timing
- spatial position

then the collision does **not** produce annihilation.

Instead, the system falls into:

- **Regime 3.1 (Merge)** → composite formation
- **Regime 3.3 (Excitation)** → energy redistribution
- **Elastic scattering** (from v12 motion engine)
- **No interaction** (if cells never coincide)

Thus, annihilation is **one possible outcome**, not the universal one.

## 5. Emergent Baryon Asymmetry

Tick‑frame physics naturally predicts that:

- **Local annihilation** is common (where patterns align).
- **Global annihilation** is extremely unlikely (patterns rarely align perfectly).
- **Residual matter** remains after early‑universe interactions.
- **Composite formation** (fusion) competes with annihilation.
- **Excitation and scattering** further diversify pattern states, reducing future overlap.

This provides a clean, ontological explanation for why the universe contains matter today.

No CP violation, no baryogenesis mechanisms, no fine‑tuned parameters.  
Just **pattern structure** and **local collision rules**.

---

## 6. Summary

Matter–antimatter annihilation in the tick‑frame universe is not a default process. It is a **precision event** requiring exact pattern matching across multiple dimensions.

Because early‑universe patterns were:

- diverse,
- desynchronized,
- rapidly evolving,
- and spatially distributed,

global annihilation was impossible.

Residual matter is therefore a **natural emergent outcome**, not a paradox.

## 7. Implications for Future Work

This perspective suggests several research directions:

- How does pattern diversity evolve over time?
- Does gravitational time dilation (γ) influence pattern alignment probability?
- Can composite formation outcompete annihilation under certain field conditions?
- Does E_max variation across spacetime bias matter survival?
- Are there stable antimatter domains where pattern alignment is suppressed?

These questions can be explored in future experiments (e.g., 55c, 55e, 56).
