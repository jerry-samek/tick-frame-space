# **RAW 086 — Rotational Asymmetry and Magnetic Well Formation**
*Formal Ontological Document (Markdown Version)*

## **0. Context**
RAW 086 formalizes **magnetism** within the gamma‑field ontology.  
Magnetism is not an independent force; it is an emergent geometric pattern arising from:

- rotation of an entity,
- temporal lag between entity and imprint,
- and the structure of the gamma well.

This document completes the core description of the gamma field by defining the **tangential component** of curvature and its interaction with entities and fragments.

## **1. Magnetic Well Definition**
A **magnetic well** is a tangential deformation of the gamma field produced by a rotating entity with non‑zero lag.

It is characterized by:

1. **asymmetric curvature** around the entity,
2. **directional flow** of imprint in the residual layer,
3. **non‑radial gradient** orthogonal to the gravitational well,
4. **persistence** proportional to rotational stability.

Magnetic wells are not separate structures; they are **the tangential component of the entity’s gamma well**.

---

## **2. Origin of Magnetic Asymmetry**
Magnetism arises from the interaction of three factors:

### **2.1 Rotation**
The entity has a rotational phase \( \theta(t) \) and angular velocity \( \omega(t) \).

### **2.2 Lag**
Lag \( L(t) \) creates temporal separation between the entity and its imprint.

### **2.3 Gamma Well Geometry**
The well integrates the entity’s history, creating a persistent curvature.

The combination produces a **shear deformation** in the imprint:

\[
\text{Magnetic Well} = f(\omega, L, W)
\]

This shear is the magnetic field.

---

## **3. Magnetic Field as Tangential Gradient**
The gamma well has two orthogonal components:

- **Radial gradient** → gravitational behavior
- **Tangential gradient** → magnetic behavior

Formally:

\[
\nabla W = \nabla_{\text{radial}} W + \nabla_{\text{tangential}} W
\]

The tangential component is the magnetic well.

---

## **4. Magnetic Interaction with Fragments**
Fragments are subcritical gamma wells (RAW 084).  
They interact with magnetic wells through:

### **4.1 Deflection**
Tangential gradients curve fragment trajectories.

### **4.2 Capture**
Strong magnetic wells can temporarily trap fragments.

### **4.3 Acceleration**
Fragments may gain or lose tangential momentum.

### **4.4 Dissipation**
Captured fragments dissipate into the residual field.

Magnetic interaction is purely geometric — no forces are added.

---

## **5. Magnetic Interaction Between Entities**
Entities with rotation interact magnetically:

### **5.1 Alignment**
Parallel rotations reinforce tangential curvature.

### **5.2 Repulsion / Attraction**
Opposing rotations create shear patterns that can:

- push entities apart,
- or draw them together,  
  depending on phase alignment.

### **5.3 Induction**
A changing rotation in one entity induces tangential curvature in another:

\[
\frac{d\omega_1}{dt} \rightarrow \Delta W_{\text{tangential, 2}}
\]

This is the ontological equivalent of electromagnetic induction.

---

## **6. Magnetic Well Strength**
Magnetic well strength depends on:

\[
M = g(\omega, L, W)
\]

Where:

- \( \omega \) = angular velocity
- \( L \) = lag
- \( W \) = depth of the gamma well

Key properties:

- \( M = 0 \) if \( \omega = 0 \)
- \( M \) increases with lag
- \( M \) saturates when well curvature reaches geometric limits
- \( M \) collapses if the entity enters energy starvation (RAW 085)

---

## **7. Magnetic Dissipation**
Magnetic wells dissipate when:

- rotation slows,
- lag collapses,
- or the entity dissolves.

Dissipation is smooth and continuous — no discontinuities or singularities.

Residual field absorbs tangential curvature as low‑energy noise.

---

## **8. Interpretation**
Magnetism is:

- a **geometric consequence** of rotation in an expanding field,
- a **tangential deformation** of the gamma well,
- a **directional imprint flow**,
- and a **shear pattern** in the residual layer.

It is not a separate force.  
It is the **angular component** of the same curvature that produces gravitational behavior.

---

## **9. Summary**
RAW 086 establishes that:

- rotating entities with lag generate magnetic wells,
- magnetism is the tangential gradient of the gamma well,
- fragments and entities interact with magnetic wells geometrically,
- induction and alignment emerge naturally,
- and magnetic structures dissipate smoothly with energy loss.

This completes the core theoretical structure of the gamma field.
