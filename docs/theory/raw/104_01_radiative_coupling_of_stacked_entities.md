## RAW 105 — Radiative coupling of stacked entities on curved potentials

### 1. Informal statement

When two entities occupy different positions along the same curved potential (same hill/well, different “orbits”), the braking radiation of the upper entity exerts a force on the lower one.

- On a **hill** (positive curvature), this force is **repulsive**: the upper entity’s emission pushes the lower entity **outward** (uphill direction).
- On a **well** (negative curvature), this force is **non‑repulsive or attractive**: emission does **not** push the lower entity outward; instead, it contributes to inward collapse.

Radiation becomes a **mediator of interaction** whose sign is set by curvature.

---

### 2. Setup

Consider a 1D curved potential with coordinate \(x\), curvature sign \(\kappa \in \{+1,-1\}\):

- \(\kappa = +1\): hill geometry (gamma hill)
- \(\kappa = -1\): well geometry

Two entities:

- Upper entity \(E_1\) at position \(x_1\)
- Lower entity \(E_2\) at position \(x_2\), with \(x_2 < x_1\) in the “downhill” direction

Each time step, \(E_1\) emits a photon with:

- momentum \(p_\gamma > 0\) in the **outward** direction (increasing \(x\))
- recoil \(\Delta p_1 = -p_\gamma\) applied to \(E_1\)

The photon then propagates according to the geometry.

---

### 3. Geometry‑dependent photon propagation

Define the effective photon propagation direction:

- **Hill (\(\kappa = +1\))**: photons move outward, away from the hill center  
  \[
  \frac{dx_\gamma}{dt} > 0
  \]
- **Well (\(\kappa = -1\))**: photons are bent inward, toward the well bottom  
  \[
  \frac{dx_\gamma}{dt} < 0
  \]

Thus, the same local emission rule (photon launched “outward”) produces opposite global behavior depending on curvature.

---

### 4. Radiative force on the lower entity

Let the photon field generated by \(E_1\) carry a flux \(F_\gamma(x)\) along the axis.

The radiative force on \(E_2\) is:

\[
F_{\text{rad},2} \propto \sigma_2 \, F_\gamma(x_2)
\]

where \(\sigma_2\) is an effective cross‑section (how strongly \(E_2\) couples to the radiation).

Now curvature decides the sign and presence of this flux at \(x_2\):

#### Hill (\(\kappa = +1\))

- Photons from \(x_1\) propagate outward and **pass through** \(x_2\).
- \(F_\gamma(x_2)\) is directed outward.
- The resulting force on \(E_2\) is outward:

\[
F_{\text{rad},2}^{(\kappa=+1)} > 0
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The upper entity’s braking radiation exerts a **repulsive, outward push** on the lower entity.

#### Well (\(\kappa = -1\))

- Photons from \(x_1\) are bent inward and accumulate near the bottom.
- The flux at \(x_2\) is not outward in a way that produces net outward recoil; it contributes to inward pressure or isotropic trapping.
- Effective outward radiative push is suppressed:

\[
F_{\text{rad},2}^{(\kappa=-1)} \le 0
\]

**Conclusion:**  
The upper entity’s braking radiation does **not** push the lower entity outward; it contributes to collapse.

---

### 5. Compact law form

You can write the core as:

\[
\operatorname{sign}\big(F_{\text{rad},2}\big) = \operatorname{sign}(\kappa)
\]

- \(\kappa = +1 \Rightarrow F_{\text{rad},2} > 0\) (repulsive, outward)
- \(\kappa = -1 \Rightarrow F_{\text{rad},2} \le 0\) (non‑repulsive, inward/neutral)

---

### 6. Ontological reading

- **Hill:** braking radiation is **exported** and becomes a **repulsive coupling** between stacked entities. The upper one can “lift” or at least push the lower one outward.
- **Well:** braking radiation is **trapped** and becomes an **attractive or collapsing coupling**. The upper one’s emission deepens the shared fall.
