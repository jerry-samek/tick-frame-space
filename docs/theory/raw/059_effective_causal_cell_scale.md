# TF‑T‑059: Effective Causal Cell Scale
**Why One Sample Represents a Sub‑Electron Pattern Unit**

**Category:** Tick‑Frame Theory  
**Status:** Draft  
**Author:** Tom  
**Scope:** Defines the physical scale of a tick‑frame “sample” (effective causal cell) and explains why it corresponds to a sub‑electron structural unit rather than a full particle.

## 1. Motivation

To model particles as emergent patterns, tick‑frame physics requires a clear definition of:

- the **substrate scale** (Planck‑level updates),
- the **effective causal cell** (sample),
- and the **pattern scale** (electron‑like objects).

This document establishes a realistic mapping between these layers so that a “pattern” in the engine can be interpreted as a simplified analogue of an electron‑sized quantum object.

## 2. Substrate: Planck‑Level Granularity

Tick‑frame assumes the deepest layer of reality updates at the Planck scale:

- **Planck length:**  
  \[
  \ell_P \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-35} \text{ m}
  \]

- **Planck time:**  
  \[
  t_P \approx 5.4 \times 10^{-44} \text{ s}
  \]

This layer is far below any known particle structure and represents the raw “update grid” of the substrate.

However, Planck‑scale cells are **too fine** to serve as meaningful units for emergent physics.  
We therefore introduce a higher‑level construct.

## 3. Effective Causal Cell (“Sample”)

A **sample** is defined as:

> A cubic region of space that light crosses in one effective tick, composed of *n³* Planck‑scale substrate cells.

This is the fundamental unit of **local causality** in the tick‑frame engine.

### 3.1 Target size for a realistic sample

To match real physics, the sample should be:

- **much larger than Planck**,
- **much smaller than an electron**,
- **large enough to encode local structure**,
- **small enough to allow patterns to span multiple samples**.

A practical and physically meaningful choice is:

\[
L_{\text{sample}} \approx 10^{-14} \text{ m}
\]

This is:

- 100× smaller than a proton,
- 100–1000× smaller than the classical electron radius,
- 100,000× smaller than the electron’s Compton wavelength.

### 3.2 Number of Planck cells per sample

\[
n = \frac{L_{\text{sample}}}{\ell_P}
\approx \frac{10^{-14}}{1.6 \times 10^{-35}}
\approx 6 \times 10^{20}
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{sample volume} \approx (6 \times 10^{20})^3 \approx 2 \times 10^{62}
\]

Each sample contains **~10⁶² substrate cells**.

## 4. Pattern Scale: Electron‑Like Objects

Real electrons are not point particles in the tick‑frame sense.  
Their effective spatial extent is given by the **Compton wavelength**:

\[
\lambda_C \approx 2.4 \times 10^{-12} \text{ m}
\]

Number of samples across this extent:

\[
N_{\text{pattern}} = \frac{\lambda_C}{L_{\text{sample}}}
\approx \frac{2.4 \times 10^{-12}}{10^{-14}}
\approx 240
\]

### **Conclusion:**

> An electron‑like pattern spans **~200–300 samples**.

This is ideal:

- small enough to be simulated,
- large enough to have internal structure,
- consistent with emergent mass, charge, and stability.

## 5. Interpretation

With this scale hierarchy:

- **substrate (Planck):** raw update layer
- **sample:** sub‑electron causal unit
- **pattern:** electron‑like emergent object
- **multi‑pattern structures:** atoms, molecules, fields

This gives a clean, realistic mapping:

### ✔ Sample = sub‑electron structural unit
### ✔ Pattern = simplified electron‑scale object
### ✔ Multi‑pattern = composite particles or atoms

---

## 6. Why This Matters

This scale choice ensures:

- **emergence** is possible (patterns span many samples),
- **locality** is preserved (samples are small),
- **realistic physics** can be approximated (electron‑scale patterns),
- **pattern overlap** can produce heavy states (γ‑collapse),
- **engineered gravity** becomes meaningful.

It also explains why brute‑force physics (LHC) must use extreme energies:

> Real particles are enormous patterns across hundreds of samples.  
> To “hit” the right configuration by chance requires astronomical energy density.

Tick‑frame avoids this by **architectural pattern alignment**, not brute force.

---

## 7. Summary

- A **sample** is a cubic region ~\(10^{-14}\) m across.
- It contains ~\(10^{62}\) Planck‑scale substrate cells.
- An **electron‑like pattern** spans ~200–300 samples.
- This makes a pattern a **simplified electron analogue**.
- This scale enables emergent mass, gravity, and pattern overlap phenomena.

This provides a consistent, realistic foundation for all higher‑level tick‑frame constructs.
