# Temporal Dimension Principle

## 1. Statement
> Time is not a fundamental dimension at the root layer.  
> It is a perceptual ordering of visualization commits (ticks), constructed by agents reading embedded artefacts.  
> Relativity’s spacetime emerges as a projection of this ordering into a continuous manifold.

## 2. Root Layer (Ontological Basis)
- **Continuous substrate:**  
  \[
  \dot{x}(t) = \Phi(x(t))
  \]
- **Planck tick:** invariant safety interval for collapse commits.  
- **No ontological timeline:** only the current tick exists; past states are closed.

---

## 3. Visualization Layer (Perceptual Time)
- **Refresh ordering:** agents perceive time as a sequence of commits.  
- **Embedded artefacts:** past events are carried forward into the current tick as informational traces.  
- **Perception of past:** agents interpret artefacts as history, but no rollback to past states is possible.  
- **Arrow of time:** enforced by irreversible commit rules (PoF guard).

---

## 4. Relativity Projection
- **Spacetime geometry:** emerges as a projection of refresh ordering into a continuous manifold.  
- **Special relativity:** velocity modulation of refresh rate ↔ Lorentz time dilation.  
- **General relativity:** density/curvature modulation ↔ gravitational time dilation.  
- **Compatibility:** Planck tick and speed of light remain invariant; perceived dilation matches relativistic predictions.

## 5. Formal Principle
- **Root axiom:**  
  Time is not a root dimension; only continuous evolution and discrete commits exist.
- **Visualization axiom:**  
  Time is the perceptual ordering of commits, reconstructed by agents from embedded artefacts.
- **Projection axiom:**  
  Relativity’s spacetime is the geometric projection of this perceptual ordering, preserving invariants.

---

## 6. Implications
- **Experimental design:**  
  - Time dilation can be modeled as modulation of refresh stability.  
  - Past events are accessible only via artefacts, not as active states.  
- **Philosophical depth:**  
  - Time is epistemic, not ontological.  
  - History is embedded, not re‑liveable.  
- **Scientific compatibility:**  
  - Framework aligns with relativity while redefining time as perception.

## 7. Conclusion
The **Temporal Dimension Principle** asserts:
- Time is not a fundamental dimension at the root.  
- It is a perceptual construct from visualization commits.  
- Relativity’s spacetime emerges as a projection of this ordering.  

This principle provides a bridge between the meta‑critical tick–refresh model and established physics, opening pathways for experimental verification and deeper theoretical synthesis.
