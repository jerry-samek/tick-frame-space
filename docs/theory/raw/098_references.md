# References and Integration Guide

This document collects the key sources used to support the foundational framework in this repository and maps each source to the chapter(s) or section(s) where it is most relevant. For each mapped item you will find a short note on relevance and a suggested inline citation format. Use short inline citations in the text (for example **[Bedingham, 2020]**) and keep the full entries in the References section below.

## Detailed integration notes by chapter

### Temporal Dynamics Principle
**Relevance**  
This chapter formulates the Temporal Dynamics Principle and discusses discrete time and its consequences for dynamical laws.

**Suggested citations**
- **Bedingham, D. J. (2020)** as the primary theoretical reference for discrete spacetime and collapse-model implications: **[Bedingham, 2020]**.
- **Bedingham & Pearle (2025)** when claims concern quantised time variables or recent model proposals: **[Bedingham & Pearle, 2025]**.

**Where to insert**
- At the first mention of “discrete time” and in paragraphs that derive consequences for dynamics or measurement.

---

### Temporal Synchronization Principle
**Relevance**  
This chapter proposes synchronization mechanisms between local time variables and discusses quantised-time models.

**Suggested citations**
- **Bedingham & Pearle (2025)** for technical details and model proposals involving quantised time: **[Bedingham & Pearle, 2025]**.

**Where to insert**
- In sections that present the mathematical model for quantised time or when claiming novelty relative to prior relativistic collapse proposals.

---

### Relativity compatibility
**Relevance**  
Addresses the compatibility of collapse mechanisms with Lorentz invariance and spacetime symmetries.

**Suggested citations**
- **Tumulka, R. (2006)** for classical discussion of the tension between collapse and relativity and proposed resolutions: **[Tumulka, 2006]**.
- **Bedingham, D. J. (2016)** for analysis of spacetime symmetries in collapse models: **[Bedingham, 2016]**.

**Where to insert**
- In any discussion of Lorentz invariance, frame-dependence of collapse events, or when comparing different relativistic collapse strategies.

---

### Collapse models and measurement philosophy
**Relevance**  
Philosophical and interpretational aspects: ontological versus epistemic readings of collapse.

**Suggested citations**
- **Bedingham, D. J. (2016)** for arguments about the ontological status of collapse and spacetime symmetries: **[Bedingham, 2016]**.
- **Objective-collapse theory** (overview) for a high-level, reader-friendly summary: **[Objective-collapse theory, Wikipedia]** (use sparingly and not as a primary technical source).

**Where to insert**
- In introductory and interpretational sections that frame what “collapse” means for the proposed theory.

---

### Discrete spacetime
**Relevance**  
Technical and conceptual consequences of treating spacetime (or time) as discrete.

**Suggested citations**
- **Bedingham, D. J. (2020)** as the main theoretical source for discrete spacetime in the context of collapse models: **[Bedingham, 2020]**.

**Where to insert**
- In derivations, model assumptions, and when discussing how discrete structure modifies continuum-based predictions.

---

### Comparison with quantum mechanics and experiments
**Relevance**  
Comparing model predictions to standard quantum mechanics and to experimental tests (interferometry, macroscopic superposition tests).

**Suggested citations**
- **Primary experimental references to add**: interferometry (Mach–Zehnder and optical interferometers), macroscopic superposition tests, and experimental constraints on collapse parameters. These are not yet included in the current reference list and should be added for completeness.

**Where to insert**
- In sections proposing experimental tests, or when claiming consistency or inconsistency with known experimental results.

---

## Recommended inline citation formats

- **Short technical claim**: `... (see discussion of discrete time) [Bedingham, 2020].`
- **Model-specific reference**: `... (quantised time model) [Bedingham & Pearle, 2025].`
- **Interpretational note**: `... (ontological reading of collapse) [Bedingham, 2016].`

## Suggested next steps

- **Add primary experimental references** for interferometry and macroscopic superposition tests. I can compile a short list of canonical experimental papers and their DOIs to append to this file.
- **Insert inline citations into repository files**. I can prepare a patch that inserts short inline citations (for example ` [Bedingham, 2020]`) into specific files and locations. Provide a list of target files or confirm that I should apply the mapping from the Quick mapping table to the main chapters.
- **Produce a .bib file** containing the BibTeX entries above plus any additional experimental references you approve.

## Change log

- **2026-01-19** Created integrated English references file with chapter mapping, detailed integration notes, full references, and BibTeX entries.
