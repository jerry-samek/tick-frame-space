## Notes

- These sources were used to ground discussion of **relativity compatibility**, **continuous vs. discrete time**, and *
  *collapse events as epistemic vs. ontological phenomena**.
- They provide the scientific backdrop for the **Temporal Dynamics Principle** and **Temporal Synchronization Principle
  ** within the ToE framework.
