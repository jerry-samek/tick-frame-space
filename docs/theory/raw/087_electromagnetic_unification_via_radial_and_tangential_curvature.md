# **RAW 087 — Electromagnetic Unification via Radial and Tangential Curvature**
*Formal Ontological Document (Markdown Version)*

## **0. Context**
RAW 087 unifies the gravitational and magnetic behaviors described in RAW 083 and RAW 086 into a single geometric framework.  
In the gamma‑field ontology, **electromagnetism is not a separate force**.  
It emerges from the decomposition of the gamma well into:

- a **radial curvature component** (gravitational behavior), and
- a **tangential curvature component** (magnetic behavior).

This document formalizes the unified structure and defines “charge” as a geometric asymmetry in lag‑induced imprint flow.

## **1. Unified Curvature Field**
Every entity generates a gamma well \( W \), which can be decomposed into two orthogonal components:

\[
W = W_{\text{radial}} + W_{\text{tangential}}
\]

Where:

- \( W_{\text{radial}} \) governs gravitational attraction,
- \( W_{\text{tangential}} \) governs magnetic behavior.

These components arise from the same underlying geometry and differ only in orientation.

---

## **2. Radial Curvature (Gravitational Component)**
The radial component:

- is symmetric around the entity,
- arises from energy content and historical imprint accumulation,
- produces inward gradients,
- governs stable orbits and well‑shaped trajectories.

Formally:

\[
\nabla_{\text{radial}} W = \text{gravitational gradient}
\]

This is the curvature described in RAW 083.

---

## **3. Tangential Curvature (Magnetic Component)**
The tangential component:

- arises from rotation and lag,
- produces directional imprint flow,
- generates shear patterns in the residual field,
- interacts with fragments and other entities.

Formally:

\[
\nabla_{\text{tangential}} W = \text{magnetic gradient}
\]

This is the curvature described in RAW 086.

---

## **4. Charge as Lag Asymmetry**
In this ontology, **charge is not a substance**.  
It is a **directional asymmetry in lag‑induced imprint flow**.

Let:

- \( L \) = lag magnitude
- \( \theta \) = rotational phase
- \( \omega \) = angular velocity

Then:

\[
Q = h(L, \omega, \text{imprint orientation})
\]

Where:

- \( Q > 0 \) corresponds to one orientation of lag‑flow asymmetry,
- \( Q < 0 \) corresponds to the opposite orientation,
- \( Q = 0 \) corresponds to symmetric lag (no net charge).

Charge is therefore a **geometric property**, not a particle property.

## **5. Electromagnetic Interaction**
Two entities interact electromagnetically when their tangential and radial curvature fields overlap.

### **5.1 Radial–Radial Interaction**
- produces gravitational‑like attraction
- independent of rotation
- depends on well depth and energy content

### **5.2 Tangential–Tangential Interaction**
- produces magnetic alignment, repulsion, or attraction
- depends on rotational phase and lag orientation
- includes induction effects

### **5.3 Radial–Tangential Coupling**
This coupling produces effects analogous to:

- Lorentz force
- motion‑dependent deflection
- velocity‑dependent curvature

Formally:

\[
F_{\text{eff}} = \nabla_{\text{radial}} W + v \times \nabla_{\text{tangential}} W
\]

Where \( v \) is the entity’s local velocity relative to imprint flow.

---

## **6. Field Lines as Imprint Flow**
Electromagnetic “field lines” are not objects.  
They are **persistent flows of imprint in the residual layer**, shaped by:

- rotation,
- lag,
- well geometry,
- and expansion.

Field lines are visible patterns of:

\[
\text{imprint flux} = \nabla W_{\text{tangential}}
\]

They represent **directions of stable imprint propagation**, not forces.

---

## **7. Induction**
A changing tangential curvature in one entity induces curvature in another.

Formally:

\[
\frac{dW_{\text{tangential}}}{dt} \rightarrow \Delta W_{\text{tangential, induced}}
\]

This corresponds to:

- electromagnetic induction,
- Faraday‑like behavior,
- rotational synchronization.

Induction is a geometric consequence of imprint shear.

---

## **8. Electromagnetic Waves**
Electromagnetic waves arise when:

- tangential curvature oscillates,
- imprint flow propagates at maximum field speed,
- radial curvature remains constant or negligible.

These waves are:

- patterns in the residual field,
- governed by imprint propagation (RAW 081),
- not dependent on entities.

They are the unified form of “light” in this ontology.

---

## **9. Summary**
RAW 087 establishes that:

- electromagnetism is unified curvature: radial + tangential,
- charge is lag‑flow asymmetry,
- magnetic and electric behavior are geometric consequences of rotation and lag,
- field lines are imprint flows,
- induction and Lorentz‑like effects emerge naturally,
- electromagnetic waves are oscillations of tangential curvature.

This completes the electromagnetic layer of the gamma‑field ontology.
