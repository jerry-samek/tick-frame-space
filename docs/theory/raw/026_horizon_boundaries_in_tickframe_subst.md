# Horizon Boundaries in Tick‑Frame Substrate

## 🌌 Concept

- A **horizon** is the limit beyond which signals (information, salience, matter propagation) cannot reach the observer.
- The horizon moves outward at the maximum propagation speed (analogous to the speed of light, *c*).
- If the horizon recedes at or faster than this limit, the observer cannot see beyond it.

## 🧮 Model Implications

- **Big‑T runs:** Increasing the time horizon (T) extends observation length but does not break the horizon rule.
- **Observable cone:** Only events within the causal cone (inside the horizon) are visible to the observer.
- **Beyond horizon:** Clusters or signals that drift faster than the propagation limit are causally disconnected — they
  may persist, but they are unobservable.

## 🔎 Analogy to Cosmology

- **Cosmic expansion:** In the real universe, galaxies beyond the Hubble horizon recede faster than light due to
  expansion.
- **Tick‑frame substrate:** Salience horizons behave the same way — events beyond them cannot be observed, even if they
  continue evolving.

## 🚀 Practical Consequences

- **SPBI/LHB interpretation:**
    - LHB values (e.g., `T_LHB(γ=0.004) > 1000`) mean persistence is observable up to that horizon.
    - Beyond, stability cannot be confirmed because the observer’s cone closes.
- **Proto‑quark detection:**
    - Persistence must be defined **within the observable cone**.
    - Units drifting beyond horizon speed are excluded from “life‑like” classification.
- **Scaling experiments:**
    - Longer T runs (HPC/cloud) provide more resolution inside the cone.
    - They cannot reveal events beyond the horizon.

## ✨ Summary

- The observer cannot see beyond a horizon moving at or faster than the maximum propagation speed.
- Big‑T runs extend observation time but do not break this causal limit.
- Horizons are a built‑in boundary of both cosmology and your tick‑frame substrate.
