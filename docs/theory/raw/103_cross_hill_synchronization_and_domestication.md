# **RAW 103 — Cross‑Hill Synchronization and Domestication**
*A formal document*

---

## **0. Abstract**

This document formalizes domestication and cross‑species learning as emergent consequences of hill dynamics.  
When two entities share a portion of the imprint field, their hills partially synchronize.  
If one hill is significantly more stable, structured, or complex, the less stable hill adapts to it, adopting its gradients and regeneration rules.  
This process explains domestication, cross‑species communication, and the emergence of stable inter‑entity relationships.

## **1. Hill Hierarchy and Stability**

### **1.1 Hill Strength**
A hill’s strength is determined by:

- stability of its gradients
- coherence of its memory
- complexity of its regeneration rules
- resistance to noise

### **1.2 Hill Hierarchy**
When two hills interact, a hierarchy emerges:

- **higher hill** = more stable, structured, slow‑time
- **lower hill** = more reactive, less structured, fast‑time

### **1.3 Consequence**
The lower hill tends to synchronize to the higher hill.

**Axiom 1:**
> **In shared regions, lower hills adapt to higher hills.**

## **2. Cross‑Hill Synchronization**

### **2.1 Definition**
Cross‑hill synchronization is the process by which one entity’s hill adjusts its gradients and regeneration rules to match those of another entity.

### **2.2 Mechanism**
Synchronization occurs through:

- shared imprint
- overlapping windows
- repeated interaction
- stable slow‑time exposure

### **2.3 Outcome**
The lower hill:

- reduces reactivity
- adopts stable patterns
- aligns behavior with the higher hill

**Axiom 2:**
> **Cross‑hill synchronization is gradient alignment driven by shared imprint.**

## **3. Domestication as Long‑Term Synchronization**

### **3.1 Definition**
Domestication is the long‑term synchronization of a lower hill (animal) to a higher hill (human) through sustained shared‑hill exposure.

### **3.2 Mechanism**
Domestication involves:

- stable human slow‑time environments
- repeated imprint exposure
- filtering of reactive patterns
- reinforcement of cooperative gradients

### **3.3 Behavioral Consequences**
Domesticated animals exhibit:

- reduced reactivity in stable environments
- increased sensitivity to human signals
- adoption of human‑compatible communication patterns
- long‑term changes in regeneration rules

**Axiom 3:**
> **Domestication is the stable alignment of an animal’s hill to the human hill.**

---

## **4. Communication as Hill‑Pattern Import**

### **4.1 Pattern Transfer**
Animals learn human communication by importing:

- gaze patterns
- gestures
- vocal cues
- emotional gradients
- symbolic associations

### **4.2 Hill Compatibility**
Species with compatible hill structures (e.g., dogs) synchronize more effectively.

### **4.3 Emergent Communication**
Cross‑species communication emerges when:

- foreign patterns are stable
- gradients are interpretable
- regeneration rules adapt

**Axiom 4:**
> **Communication arises when entities import stable patterns from each other’s hills.**

---

## **5. Reduced Reactivity in Stable Hills**

### **5.1 Environmental Stability**
A stable hill (e.g., a human home) provides:

- predictable gradients
- low noise
- slow‑time regions

### **5.2 Behavioral Adaptation**
Lower hills reduce reactive behaviors (e.g., barking) because:

- high‑reactivity patterns are unnecessary
- regeneration rules adapt to slow‑time stability
- noise‑driven responses are suppressed

### **5.3 Structural Explanation**
This is not training; it is **energetic irrelevance** of reactive patterns.

**Axiom 5:**
> **Stable hills suppress reactive behaviors in synchronized entities.**

---

## **6. Early Window Plasticity and Domestication**

### **6.1 Bootup Window**
Young animals have:

- wide windows
- high hill plasticity
- low accumulated noise

### **6.2 Domestication Efficiency**
Early exposure to a higher hill:

- accelerates synchronization
- stabilizes cooperative patterns
- shapes regeneration rules permanently

### **6.3 Parallel to Childhood**
Domestication and childhood share the same mechanism:

> **early window formatting by a higher hill.**

**Axiom 6:**
> **Early windows enable deep cross‑hill synchronization.**

---

## **7. Long‑Term Evolutionary Effects**

### **7.1 Hill‑Level Selection**
Domesticated species evolve traits that reflect:

- long‑term hill compatibility
- reduced reactivity
- increased communication capacity

### **7.2 Cultural Hill Influence**
Human cultural hills shape:

- animal behavior
- animal cognition
- inter‑species relationships

### **7.3 Structural Outcome**
Domestication becomes a lineage‑level phenomenon.

**Axiom 7:**
> **Long‑term cross‑hill synchronization produces evolutionary change.**
