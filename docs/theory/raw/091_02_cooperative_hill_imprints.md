# **RAW 095 — Cooperative Hill Imprints**
### *Why Processes Align on a Rising Gamma Hill*

---

## **1. Purpose**

This document formalizes the cooperative behavior of processes within the Gamma Hill Model.  
It explains why processes tend to align their imprints and how shared hill‑building increases available energy.

---

## **2. Core Principle**

> **Processes gain more usable energy when they contribute to a shared rising hill than when they act in isolation.**

The gamma hill encodes resistance, compatibility, and energy availability.  
A higher hill corresponds to a region of increased imprint coherence and reduced residual.

---

## **3. Mechanism of Cooperative Hill Formation**

### **3.1 Individual Imprints**
Each process modifies the gamma hill through its imprint:

- coherent imprint → raises the hill
- dissipative imprint → lowers or roughens the hill
- incompatible imprint → introduces turbulence and residual

### **3.2 Shared Gradient Reinforcement**
When multiple processes align their imprint patterns:

- resistance decreases
- residual decreases
- gradients become smoother
- the hill rises more efficiently

This produces a **collective energy gain** that no single process can achieve alone.

---

## **4. Energy Incentive for Cooperation**

### **4.1 Hill Height as Energy Access**
A higher hill provides:

- increased energy compatibility
- reduced dissipation
- improved stability
- access to stronger gradients

### **4.2 Cooperative Advantage**
Aligned processes:

- reinforce each other’s imprints
- minimize destructive interference
- share the rising hill
- gain more energy than isolated processes

Thus cooperation is not optional; it is **energetically optimal**.

---

## **5. Black Hill as Ultimate Cooperative Attractor**

The “black hill” represents the limit of maximal imprint compatibility:

- minimal residual
- maximal energy recycling
- fully aligned lag structures

Only processes that cooperate at the deepest level can remain stable in this region.

---

## **6. Summary**

- Processes imprint the gamma hill.
- Shared, compatible imprints raise the hill more efficiently.
- A higher hill yields more usable energy.
- Therefore, **processes are geometrically incentivized to cooperate**.
- The black hill is the ultimate cooperative attractor.
