# Energy Constant Principle (Scientific Formulation)

**Definition**  
In a closed tick‑frame universe, the **energy constant** is defined as:

\[
E_{\text{constant}}(t) = \frac{\sum E_{\text{entity}}(t)}{t} - \sum(\text{momentum costs})
\]

This value should remain approximately zero across ticks.  
Raw energy may grow or decay exponentially based on initial momentum, but normalized by tick count and balanced against
momentum costs, the invariant holds.

## Core Ideas

- **Zero‑sum conservation law**  
  Normalized energy minus momentum costs ≈ 0 each tick.
- **Momentum as expenditure**  
  Collisions and movements are costs subtracted from normalized energy.
- **Temporal normalization principle**  
  Entities with different raw energies at different ticks can be equivalent surfers if their normalized values match.
- **Condensation and dissolution**  
  Blobs redistribute energy but do not break the invariant.
- **Entropy narrative**  
  Extinction events (e.g., OOM) mark saturation, but normalized energy remains bounded near zero.

## Philosophical Echo

Persistence is defined not by raw exponential magnitude, but by normalized renewal across ticks.  
The **Energy Constant Principle** ensures collisions surf time honestly, without leaking energy.
