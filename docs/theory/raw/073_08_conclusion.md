# **Conclusion**

## **Summary**
The applied methodology did not reveal any measurable relationship between galaxy distance (1–50 Mly) and the required jitter/ZPE normalization. The results are dominated by local galaxy properties rather than cosmological effects.

## **Findings**

### **1. No correlation with distance**
The normalized jitter values (\(\tilde{J}\)) show no monotonic or systematic trend with distance. Nearby, intermediate, and more distant galaxies all exhibit values spanning several orders of magnitude without pattern.

### **2. Dominance of local structure**
Variations in jitter are primarily driven by:

- total mass
- effective radius
- central concentration
- galaxy morphology

These structural differences overshadow any potential cosmological signal.

### **3. No directional anisotropy**
Dividing galaxies into sky sectors (northern hemisphere, southern hemisphere, galactic plane, Local Group) does not reveal any directional dependence. Jitter values remain inconsistent within and across sectors.

### **4. Method inconclusive**
Given the limited lookback time (tens of millions of years) and strong object‑to‑object variability, this method cannot confirm or refute any hypothesis involving epochal drift of jitter or zero‑point energy.

## **Conclusion**
**The current methodology does not yield a cosmological conclusion.  
The jitter/ZPE theory remains unproven with this dataset.**

## **Implication for future work**
A meaningful test would require:

- galaxies or clusters separated by **hundreds of millions to billions of light‑years**,
- consistent comparison across **the same class of objects**,
- and a dataset spanning significant **cosmic lookback time**.
