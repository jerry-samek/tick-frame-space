# **RAW 083 — Entity as a Self‑Maintained Gamma Well**

*Formal Ontological Document (Markdown Version)*

## **0. Context**

RAW 083 defines an entity as a process that exists by exploiting the energetic difference between the old and the newly
expanded state of space.  
This difference arises from the combination of:

- spatial expansion,
- lagged imprint,
- and the entity’s rotation, which maintains its gamma well.

RAW 083 connects directly to RAW 081 (Photon as a Stationary Imprint) and RAW 082 (Composite Object Stability).

## **1. Definition of an Entity**

An entity is a temporally extended process that:

1. creates and maintains its own gamma well,
2. interacts with an expanding field,
3. extracts energy from the potential difference between old and new space,
4. leaves a lagged imprint,
5. and uses energy for motion, growth, and stabilization.

An entity is not an object.  
It is a **time‑distributed energetic asymmetry**.

---

## **2. Gamma Well**

A gamma well is a local deformation of the field caused by the entity’s history.

- It is the integral of past imprints.
- It is the entity’s natural potential.
- It is its stable reference frame.
- It is the “well” the entity carves through rotation.

The gamma well evolves slowly because it is an accumulation of past states.

---

## **3. Energy Budget of the Entity**

Each tick, the entity has energy \(E_t\), which it distributes as:

\[
E_t = E_{\text{bind}} + E_{\text{move}} + E_{\text{emit}}
\]

### **3.1 Binding Energy**

\[
E_{\text{bind}} = \alpha E_t
\]

Maintains the gamma well and ensures continuity.

### **3.2 Motion Energy**

\[
E_{\text{move}} = \beta E_t
\]

Determines the maximum change in position and rotation.

### **3.3 Emission Energy (Lagged Imprint)**

\[
E_{\text{emit}} = E_t - E_{\text{bind}} - E_{\text{move}}
\]

The remaining energy becomes a delayed imprint in the field.

---

## **4. Lag as a Potential Separator**

Lag is the difference between:

- the entity’s position at time \(t\),
- and the position of its imprint at time \(t - L\).

Lag creates **temporal separation**, which enables an energetic gradient.

Lag is not an error.  
Lag is a **source of energy**.

---

## **5. Spatial Expansion**

Each tick, space expands:

\[
\text{scale}(t+1) = \text{scale}(t) + \Delta s
\]

This creates a new potential that is always slightly “higher” than the old one.

---

## **6. Energy Gain of the Entity**

The entity has part of its imprint in:

- the old field (lower potential),
- the new field (higher potential).

The difference yields:

\[
\Delta E = f(\text{lag}, \Delta s)
\]

This is the **net energy gain** that allows the entity to:

- exist,
- grow,
- move,
- and maintain its gamma well.

This is directly analogous to the **potential difference in a battery**.

---

## **7. Stability Condition**

The entity is stable if:

\[
E_{\text{bind}} \leq \Delta E
\]

If the energy gain exceeds the cost of maintaining the well, the entity:

- survives,
- grows,
- and leaves a coherent trail.

If not, it dissolves into the residual field.

---

## **8. Interpretation**

An entity is:

- an energetic surfer,
- living off the difference between old and new space,
- maintaining itself through rotation,
- leaving a delayed imprint,
- and using its own history as the foundation of its gamma well.

RAW 083 defines the first form of **emergent metabolism** in the ontology.
