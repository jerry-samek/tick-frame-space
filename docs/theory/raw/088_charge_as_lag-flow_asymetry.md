# **RAW 088 — Charge as Lag‑Flow Asymmetry**  
*Formal Ontological Document (Markdown Version)*

## **0. Context**
RAW 088 defines **charge** within the gamma‑field ontology.  
Charge is not a substance, not a property of matter, and not a standalone parameter.  
It is a **geometric asymmetry** in the imprint flow caused by the interaction of:

- lag,  
- rotation,  
- and gamma‑well curvature.

Charge emerges naturally from the unified curvature field described in RAW 087.

## **1. Definition of Charge**
**Charge** is a directional asymmetry in the imprint flow generated by an entity with non‑zero lag and rotation.

Formally:

\[
Q = f(L, \omega, \phi)
\]

Where:

- \( L \) = lag magnitude  
- \( \omega \) = angular velocity  
- \( \phi \) = orientation of the imprint relative to the entity’s motion  

Charge is therefore:

- **geometric**,  
- **process‑dependent**,  
- **orientation‑dependent**,  
- and **not intrinsic** to any static object.

---

## **2. Charge as Imprint‑Flow Orientation**
Lag creates a temporal offset between the entity and its imprint.  
Rotation shears this offset into a directional flow.

If the imprint flow spirals in one orientation, the entity exhibits:

- **positive charge**.

If the imprint flow spirals in the opposite orientation, the entity exhibits:

- **negative charge**.

If the imprint flow is symmetric, the entity exhibits:

- **zero charge**.

Thus:

\[
Q > 0 \iff \text{lag‑flow spirals clockwise (in field coordinates)}
\]
\[
Q < 0 \iff \text{lag‑flow spirals counterclockwise}
\]
\[
Q = 0 \iff \text{lag‑flow symmetric}
\]

Charge is simply **the handedness of imprint shear**.

---

## **3. Charge and Tangential Curvature**
Charge determines the **sign** of the tangential curvature component:

\[
\text{sign}(Q) = \text{sign}(\nabla_{\text{tangential}} W)
\]

This means:

- positive charge → tangential curvature twists one way  
- negative charge → tangential curvature twists the opposite way  
- zero charge → no net tangential curvature  

This is the geometric origin of electric polarity.

---

## **4. Charge Interaction**
Two entities interact electromagnetically through the overlap of their tangential curvature fields.

### **4.1 Like Charges**
Entities with the same lag‑flow orientation produce:

- reinforcing tangential curvature,  
- increased shear,  
- and **effective repulsion**.

### **4.2 Opposite Charges**
Entities with opposite lag‑flow orientation produce:

- canceling tangential curvature,  
- reduced shear,  
- and **effective attraction**.

This reproduces Coulomb‑like behavior without invoking forces.

---

## **5. Charge and Motion**
Charge interacts with motion through the unified curvature field:

\[
F_{\text{eff}} = \nabla_{\text{radial}} W + v \times \nabla_{\text{tangential}} W
\]

Thus:

- moving charged entities experience deflection,  
- stationary charged entities interact through curvature overlap,  
- and charge‑motion coupling produces Lorentz‑like effects.

---

## **6. Charge Conservation**
Charge is conserved because:

- lag cannot spontaneously flip orientation,  
- rotation cannot spontaneously reverse without external influence,  
- imprint flow is continuous and cannot break.

Charge can only change through:

- absorption of fragments with oriented tangential curvature,  
- interaction with another entity’s magnetic well,  
- or rotational induction (RAW 087).

Thus, charge conservation is a **topological constraint**.

---

## **7. Charge Neutrality**
An entity is neutral when:

- its lag‑flow is symmetric,  
- or its rotational shear cancels internally,  
- or it consists of sub‑patterns with opposite orientations.

Neutrality is not the absence of structure — it is **balanced structure**.

---

## **8. Charge and Fragment Interaction**
Fragments (RAW 084) carry subcritical wells with weak tangential curvature.

They can:

- reinforce charge (if aligned),  
- reduce charge (if opposite),  
- or be absorbed without effect (if symmetric).

This provides a natural mechanism for:

- charge screening,  
- charge buildup,  
- and charge dissipation.

---

## **9. Summary**
RAW 088 establishes that:

- charge is a geometric asymmetry in lag‑induced imprint flow,  
- polarity corresponds to the handedness of tangential curvature,  
- like charges repel and opposite charges attract through curvature overlap,  
- charge interacts with motion via unified curvature,  
- charge is conserved as a topological property,  
- and fragments provide a mechanism for charge modulation.

Charge is not a substance — it is **orientation in the gamma field**.
