# Extended Relativity in a Tick‑Frame Universe

## 1. Proper Time vs Observer Time

### 1.1 Proper Time (Substrate Time)

The substrate advances in discrete, uniform ticks:

\[
\tau_{\text{proper}} = \text{substrate tick count}
\]

Properties:

- global
- deterministic
- uniform
- independent of observers

This is the “true” time of the universe.

---

### 1.2 Observer Time (Sampling Time)

Observers run asynchronously and may not process every tick:

\[
\tau_{\text{observer}} = \text{ticks actually processed}
\]

Observer time depends on:

- computational load
- regional complexity
- observable cost
- event‑driven scheduling
- thread contention

Thus observer time is **local, subjective, and emergent**.

---

## 2. Time Dilation as Sampling Collapse

The effective dilation factor is:

\[
\gamma_{\text{eff}} = \frac{\tau_{\text{observer}}}{\tau_{\text{proper}}}
\]

Interpretation:

- **1.0** → observer keeps up with the substrate
- **< 1.0** → observer lags behind
- **→ 0** → observer sees time nearly frozen

This is the discrete analogue of relativistic time dilation.

Unlike continuous relativity:

- nothing diverges
- no infinities appear
- the effect is a **collapse of sampling frequency**, not an infinite slowdown

This aligns with the *Relativity Without Infinity* principle.

## 3. Emergent Relativistic Phenomena

### 3.1 Time Dilation

Heavy computational regions cause observers to fall behind:

- high adjacency density
- deep curvature
- complex motifs
- high entropy

Result:

- fewer ticks processed
- slower perceived time
- emergent dilation

The substrate itself remains unaffected.

---

### 3.2 Length Contraction

Sparse sampling reduces visible intermediate positions:

- paths appear shorter
- motion appears more direct
- contraction becomes a perceptual artifact

This reproduces the phenomenology of relativity without requiring continuous geometry.

---

### 3.3 Effective Speed of Light

The maximum observable velocity is limited by sampling:

\[
v_{\text{max, observed}} = \frac{\text{max steps per processed tick}}{\text{ticks processed}}
\]

If sampling collapses:

- the effective speed of light drops
- distant or complex regions appear frozen
- local regions appear normal

This naturally produces **observer‑dependent horizons**.

---

## 4. Why No Infinities Appear

In continuous relativity:

- time dilation → ∞
- curvature → ∞
- density → ∞

In the tick‑frame model:

- observers simply miss ticks
- sampling frequency → 0
- no quantity diverges

This integrates directly with the **Infinity Removal Principle**:

> **Extreme phenomena manifest as loss of resolution, not infinite values.**

## ✅ Extended Relativity Takeaway

- **Proper time** is substrate tick count.
- **Observer time** is ticks actually processed.
- **Time dilation** emerges from sampling collapse.
- **Length contraction** emerges from sparse sampling.
- **Speed of light** becomes a sampling limit.
- **No infinities appear** — all divergences collapse toward zero.
- This extends the basic relativity chapter and complements the Infinity Removal Principle.
