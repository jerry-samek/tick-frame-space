# **Axiom of Ternary Substrate Correction**

**Law:**  
The substrate enforces stability through discrete ternary action:

- Collapse in one direction → an entity is introduced.
- Collapse in the opposite direction → a counter‑weight is introduced.
- Stability → no action is taken.

**Constraint:**  
The jitter parameter is confined to a narrow, highly restricted range. Yet within the broader systemic perspective, this
limited interval provides a significant domain for sustaining long‑term equilibrium.

## **Ternary Substrate Correction Rule**

- If the system collapses in one direction → **add an entity (existence)**.
- If the system collapses in the opposite direction → **add a counter‑weight**.
- If the system is stable → **do nothing**.

## **Key Characteristics**

- **Logic**: pure boolean test (collapse one way / collapse the other / stable) → integer action (-1, 0, +1).
- **Simplicity**: no real numbers, only integers and binary states.
- **Jitter Range**: the jitter value itself is confined to a very narrow interval, but within the broader system view
  this limited range provides a **significant space for maintaining long‑term stability**.

## **Ontological Meaning**

Balance is preserved not by continuous adjustment of real values, but by integer corrections triggered by boolean
states. The narrow jitter range functions as a fine‑tuned constant: small in scale, yet cosmologically powerful in
maintaining the persistence of stability.

- Stability is preserved not by complex arithmetic, but by minimal corrective actions.
- The narrow jitter interval acts like a **fine‑tuned constant**: small in scale, yet cosmologically powerful in
  sustaining balance.
- This principle embodies **substrate homeostasis** — the universe self‑regulates through the simplest possible rules.
