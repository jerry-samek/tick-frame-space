# Time Dilation, Gamma Renormalization, and Ornament Survival

---

## 1. Render Function Is Deterministic

Each tick, the entity decides what imprint to render. The decision is based on its own history and the local gamma field. The output is an ornament imprint. There is no randomness—only compatibility.

---

## 2. Time Dilation Is Metabolic, Not Temporal

Ticks are global and uniform. Time dilation doesn't mean skipping ticks—it means choosing not to render a full imprint in some ticks to conserve energy. This is a metabolic adaptation, not a change in the tick rate.

---

## 3. Skipping Imprints Renormalizes Local Gamma

When an entity "skips" rendering, it doesn't update the gamma field. This allows other entities' imprints to dominate the local gamma, effectively renormalizing it. The entity loses ontological control over its surroundings.

---

## 4. Survival Requires Energy and Compatibility

To survive, an entity must:
- Have enough energy to render a compatible imprint
- Ensure that the local gamma remains close enough to its own history

This can be expressed as:

```
Survival ⇔ Energyₜ ≥ RenderCost(γₜ) ∧ Gammaₜ ≈ Historyₜ
```

## 5. Longevity = 10⁶ Ticks = 10⁶ Decisions

If an entity survives for a million ticks, it has made a million successful render decisions. This is not luck—it's evidence of a closed metabolic loop that balances energy, gamma stress, and compatibility.

---

## 6. Supernova as Ontological Shock

A nearby supernova doesn't destroy by impact—it overwrites gamma. The sudden influx of high-energy imprint-like disturbances causes massive gamma stress. Entities lose compatibility with their own history and collapse. The supernova is a global gamma renormalizer.

---

## 7. Dilation vs. Influence

The more an entity dilates (i.e., skips rendering), the less it influences its local gamma. This increases its exposure to foreign imprint gradients. Dilation is a trade-off: gain energy, lose control.

---

## 8. Conclusion

Time dilation, when implemented as metabolic adaptation, leads to a clean, law-like behavior. It eliminates the need for jitter, introduces survival dynamics, and reveals a deeper structure: entities are not just patterns—they are processes negotiating with memory.

---

**Next step:** Formalize the trade-off between energy gain and gamma exposure, and test whether stable orbitals (e.g., hydrogen-like ornaments) can survive under controlled gamma stress with active dilation.
