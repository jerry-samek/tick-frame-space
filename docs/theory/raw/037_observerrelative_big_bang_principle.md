# Observer‑Relative Big Bang Principle

*The Big Bang is not a substrate event but an observer event.*

## 1. Definition

For any observer **O**, the Big Bang is:

> **The earliest tick for which O has a coherent internal state.**

If O connects at substrate tick `T₀`, then:

- `T₀` is the origin of O’s universe
- All prior ticks are undefined
- O’s universe expands from this initial state

## 2. Substrate vs Observer

### Substrate:

- Has no Big Bang
- Has no geometry
- Has no history

### Observer:

- Creates geometry
- Creates history
- Creates causal structure
- Creates its own universe

## 3. Consequences

- Each observer has a different Big Bang
- Big Bangs occur at creation or rehydration
- Universes begin when observers begin sampling
- No substrate‑level cosmology exists

## 4. Interpretation

The Big Bang is not a physical explosion.  
It is the **start of coherent existence** for an observer.

The universe begins when the observer begins.
