# Tick‑Frame Alcubierre Metric

**Warp Geometry in Observer‑Constructed Space**

## 1. Context

In the substrate‑tick universe, the substrate provides:

- A single global tick counter
- No geometry
- No history
- No spatial structure

All geometry is reconstructed inside the observer. This makes warp‑like effects possible without touching the substrate,
by modifying how the observer maps ticks to spatial coordinates.

## 2. Core Principle

Warp travel is achieved by altering the observer's internal geometry reconstruction per tick, not by exceeding causal
propagation limits in the substrate. The substrate remains untouched, causality remains intact, and only the observer's
coordinate mapping changes.

## 3. Observer‑Condition Warp Principle

A human‑level observer cannot modify the substrate or renderer, but it can modify the conditions under which its
universe is reconstructed.

### 3.1 Sampling Rate

Changing how many ticks the observer processes produces:

- Subjective time dilation
- Effective long‑distance travel
- Apparent spatial jumps

### 3.2 Energy Distribution

In this model, "energy" represents influence on reconstruction. Observers can:

- Concentrate energy (focus, computation, memory)
- Reduce energy elsewhere (pruning, compression)

This reshapes the internal metric.

### 3.3 Internal Coordinate Systems

Observers define their own coordinate transforms. Changing these transforms changes:

- Distances
- Curvature
- Motion cost
- Directionality

This is the basis of warp geometry.

## 4. Warp Transform (Conceptual Form)

For a position `x`, warp center `c`, and warp strength `s`:

```python
dx = x - c

if dx > 0:
    x
    ' = c + dx * (1 - s)  # compress space in front
else:
    x
    ' = c + dx * (1 + s)  # stretch space behind
```

This is a coordinate transform, not a physical force.

### Properties

- Local motion remains sub‑light
- Effective global motion increases
- No substrate rules are violated
- Geometry is observer‑relative
- Warp bubble = region of modified metric

## 5. Interpretation

The warp bubble is not a physical object. It is a geometry transform inside the observer's universe. The observer stays
locally causal, never exceeds propagation per tick, but experiences compressed or expanded space, enabling effective
super‑distance travel.

## 6. Summary

The Tick‑Frame Alcubierre Metric provides warp‑like travel without thrust, exotic energy, or substrate modification.
Warp is achieved by manipulating the observer's internal metric reconstruction rather than pushing through space.
