# **RAW 085 — Energy Starvation and Entity Dissolution**
*Formal Ontological Document (Markdown Version)*

## **0. Context**
RAW 085 formalizes the behavior of a self‑maintaining entity when the energy it receives from the potential difference of the expanding gamma field becomes insufficient to sustain its gamma well, lag, and internal dynamics.

This document extends RAW 083 (Entity as a Self‑Maintained Gamma Well) and RAW 084 (Subcritical Gamma Wells and Fragment Emission) by describing the **low‑energy regime**, where the entity transitions from stable persistence to dissolution.

## **1. Definition of Energy Starvation**
Energy starvation occurs when the energy gained from the potential difference between old and new space is insufficient to maintain the entity’s required internal budget:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{in}} < E_{\text{bind, min}}
\]

where:

- \( \Delta E_{\text{in}} \) is the energy absorbed from expansion via lag,
- \( E_{\text{bind, min}} \) is the minimum energy required to maintain the gamma well and identity of the entity.

This condition initiates a sequence of compensatory behaviors.

---

## **2. Immediate Response: Lag Reduction**
When energy intake becomes insufficient, the entity reduces its lag:

\[
L(t+1) = L(t) - \delta L
\]

Reducing lag:

- decreases the energy gradient,
- lowers the cost of maintaining the well,
- and stabilizes the entity temporarily.

Lag reduction is the first and most efficient survival mechanism.

---

## **3. Well Minimization**
If energy starvation persists, the entity reduces the depth and curvature of its gamma well:

\[
W(t+1) = W(t) - \delta W
\]

A shallower well:

- requires less binding energy,
- reduces curvature stress,
- and preserves identity at minimal cost.

This is analogous to a soliton shrinking toward its critical threshold.

---

## **4. Motion Suppression**
To conserve energy, the entity reduces or halts its motion:

- radial movement decreases,
- angular velocity decreases,
- rotational dynamics stabilize.

Motion is optional; well maintenance is not.  
Thus, motion is sacrificed first.

---

## **5. Fragment Emission Ceases**
In the low‑energy regime:

- no excess energy exists,
- no curvature needs to be shed,
- fragment emission stops entirely.

The entity enters a **conservative mode** where every unit of energy is used for survival.

---

## **6. Progressive Dissolution**
If energy starvation continues over many ticks, the entity undergoes a gradual dissolution process:

### **6.1 Lag Collapse**
\[
L \rightarrow 0
\]
The entity loses temporal separation from its imprint.

### **6.2 Well Flattening**
\[
W \rightarrow 0
\]
The gamma well becomes indistinguishable from the background field.

### **6.3 Identity Loss**
The entity’s imprint becomes diffuse and incoherent.

### **6.4 Residual Absorption**
Remaining energy disperses into the residual field.

This is not an explosion or collapse — it is a **smooth thermodynamic fade‑out**.

---

## **7. No Singularities, No Runaway Collapse**
The ontology ensures that:

- wells have finite depth,
- lag has finite range,
- energy intake is bounded,
- and emission regulates excess.

Therefore:

- no singularities form,
- no infinite curvature arises,
- no catastrophic collapse occurs.

Even extreme compression (analogous to a black hole) remains a **finite, stable pattern**, not a singularity.

---

## **8. Interpretation**
Energy starvation reveals that an entity is:

- a self‑maintaining process,
- dependent on environmental energy flow,
- capable of adaptive minimization,
- and ultimately dissolvable when conditions fail.

Dissolution is not a failure — it is the natural endpoint of a process whose parameters fall below the stability threshold.

---

## **9. Summary**
RAW 085 establishes that:

- entities can receive insufficient energy from the potential difference,
- they respond by reducing lag, minimizing their well, and suppressing motion,
- fragment emission ceases,
- and prolonged starvation leads to smooth dissolution into the residual field.

This mechanism ensures global stability of the gamma field and prevents singularities or runaway collapse.
