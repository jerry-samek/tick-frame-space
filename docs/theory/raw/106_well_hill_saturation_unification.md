# RAW 106 — Well-Hill Saturation Unification: The Space-Ball

## 1. Purpose

This document resolves the false dichotomy between **well** and **hill** interpretations of the gamma field
(RAW 091-104). The resolution: they are not competing models. **A hill is the surface of a saturated well.**
The two geometries represent different maturation stages of the same structure.

This provides:
- A mechanical explanation for the Rising Hill Principle (RAW 091)
- A correction to the scope of RAW 104's emission-recoil analysis
- A natural mechanism for entity specialization without rule differentiation
- A unified picture: the **Space-Ball**

## 2. The Saturation Principle

### 2.1 Statement

> **A well that accumulates trapped radiation transitions continuously from
> depression to plateau to hill. The hill IS the surface of a full well.**

### 2.2 Stages of saturation

| Stage | Geometry | Radiation state | Entity behavior |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Empty well | Deep depression | Trapped, accumulating | Falls inward, collapses |
| Filling well | Shallow depression | Pressure building | Slowing descent |
| Saturated well | Flat plateau | Recycled, equilibrium | Stable on surface |
| Overflowing | Hill with slopes | Escapes down slopes | Orbits on gradient |

The transition is continuous and driven by a single mechanism: **cumulative imprint deposition
and diffusion**.

### 2.3 Formal sketch

Let \(\gamma(x, t)\) be the gamma field value at position \(x\) and tick \(t\).

An entity at position \(x_0\) deposits energy \(\varepsilon = 1.0\) per tick. Diffusion
redistributes energy to neighbors with weight \(w = 1/7\) (hex grid).

In steady state for a single stationary entity:

\[
\gamma_{\text{peak}} \approx \frac{\varepsilon}{1 - w} = \frac{1.0}{6/7} = 7.0
\]

For \(N\) entities concentrated in a cluster of radius \(R_c\):

\[
\gamma_{\text{center}} \approx N \cdot f(R_c)
\]

where \(f(R_c)\) is a decreasing function of cluster radius (tighter cluster = higher peak).

**Saturation occurs** when the central gamma value stabilizes — when the rate of deposition
equals the rate of diffusion outward. At this point, the well is full and the profile
becomes a hill to any entity approaching from outside.

## 3. The Space-Ball

### 3.1 Unified geometry

The Space-Ball is the name for the unified well-hill structure:

```
Cross-section:

        ████████████████    ← flat top (saturated interior)
      ░░████████████████░░
    ░░░░██████████████░░░░░░   ← slopes (hill gradient)
  ░░░░░░░░████████░░░░░░░░░░
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ← far field (flat, no gradient)
```

- **Interior (██)**: Saturated well. Gamma is high and approximately uniform.
  No gradient → entities stay → they fill and maintain the structure.
  This is the **nucleus**.

- **Slopes (░░)**: Hill gradient. Gamma decreases outward.
  Gradient exists → entities move → orbits, radiation, complexity.
  This is the **orbital zone**.

- **Far field**: Flat gamma (near zero or background). No dynamics.

### 3.2 The hill rises because the well fills

The Rising Hill Principle (RAW 091) stated:

> "Entities do not climb the gamma hill. The hill rises beneath them."

RAW 106 provides the **mechanism**: the hill rises because entity imprints flow downward
through diffusion, filling the well beneath. Each tick:

1. Entity deposits energy at its position (top of the structure)
2. Diffusion spreads this energy outward and downward
3. The accumulated energy below forms the well's content
4. The surface of this content IS the hill

The hill does not rise magically. It rises because it is being **filled from above**.

---

## 4. Positional Specialization

### 4.1 The universal question

How can identical entities, following identical rules, produce differentiated structures
(nucleus vs orbitals)?

### 4.2 The answer: position determines fate

All entities execute the same logic:
1. Gain 1 energy per tick
2. Deposit energy as gamma imprint
3. If on local gamma maximum → STAY
4. If gradient exists → MOVE along it
5. Replicate on failed orbit

**Center of cluster**: surrounded by other depositing entities. Gamma is high and
approximately isotropic. No strong gradient in any direction → local maximum → rule
says STAY. Entity becomes a well-filler (nucleus member) by geometric circumstance.

**Edge of cluster**: gamma is higher toward center, lower outward. Clear gradient exists →
rule says MOVE. Heading and occupancy push tangentially (center is occupied) → entity
orbits. Becomes an orbital by geometric circumstance.

### 4.3 No programming required

This is not specialization by instruction. It is specialization by **symmetry breaking**.
Any group of entities creates a center and edges. The center has no gradient. The edges do.
The same rules produce different behaviors at different positions.

This mirrors:
- **Embryonic differentiation**: same genome, different position → different cell fate
  (Wolpert's positional information)
- **Stellar formation**: same gas, center collapses to core, edge forms accretion disk
- **Crystal nucleation**: center atoms are locked, surface atoms are mobile

## 5. Correction to RAW 104

### 5.1 What RAW 104 got right

The emission-recoil analysis (RAW 104_00, 104_01) correctly describes the **instantaneous,
pre-saturation regime**:

- In wells: outward emission → inward recoil → pushes entity deeper
- In hills: outward emission → uphill recoil → brakes descent
- Compact law: \(\operatorname{sign}(F_{\text{rad},2}) = \operatorname{sign}(\kappa)\)

These results are valid for single emission events.

### 5.2 What RAW 104 missed

The analysis does not account for **cumulative radiation trapping** and its consequences:

1. **Time-integrated behavior**: Over many ticks, trapped radiation in a well accumulates.
   The radiation density \(\rho_{\text{rad}}\) grows monotonically until a saturation
   equilibrium is reached.

2. **Backreaction**: Accumulated radiation modifies the effective potential. The well becomes
   shallower as radiation pressure builds, eventually transitioning to a plateau (flat top).

3. **Energy recycling**: On a hill, emitted radiation escapes → energy is permanently lost.
   In a well, emitted radiation is trapped → energy is recycled → no net energy loss at
   saturation.

4. **Saturation stability**: Post-saturation, the well is self-supporting. The entity does
   not need to actively fight gravity because radiation pressure does it. This creates
   a stable equilibrium with **no hill analog**.

### 5.3 Revised statement

The emission-recoil duality of RAW 104 applies to the **transient regime**. In the
**steady-state regime**, the distinction between well and hill dissolves: a saturated well
IS a hill, and the radiation dynamics of each are aspects of a single unified structure
(the Space-Ball).

---

## 6. Implications

### 6.1 The well/hill distinction is temporal, not structural

- **Young structures** are wells: collapsing, accumulating radiation, not yet stable.
- **Mature structures** are hills: saturated, stable, radiating outward from the slopes.
- The transition from well to hill is the "ignition" moment — analogous to stellar ignition
  when radiation pressure first balances gravitational collapse.

### 6.2 Both models are correct, at different times

- RAW 091-093 (hill model supports life): correct for **mature** structures
- RAW 104 (well traps radiation): correct for **young** structures
- Neither is universally true. Both describe phases of the same process.

### 6.3 Energy budget reconciliation

- Pre-saturation: energy is consumed by collapse (well regime). RAW 091's claim that
  "wells can't support reproduction" is correct here.
- Post-saturation: energy is recycled, surplus emerges from the slopes. RAW 093's claim
  that "hills generate surplus" is correct here.
- The surplus comes not from the hill geometry per se, but from the **overflow** of a
  saturated well.

### 6.4 Simulation prediction

A cluster of identical entities should naturally produce:
1. Center entities that stay → fill the well → form a nucleus (high, flat gamma)
2. Edge entities that move → orbit on the gamma gradient → form orbital shells
3. A transition zone where the flat interior meets the sloped exterior
4. This structure should be self-sustaining: nucleus entities maintain the well,
   orbital entities interact with the gradient

## 7. Summary

| RAW 091-093 claim | RAW 104 claim | RAW 106 resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Hill generates surplus | Well traps radiation | Saturated well = hill. Both are stages. |
| Well can't support reproduction | Emission deepens descent in wells | Pre-saturation only. Post-saturation: well is stable. |
| Hill is the correct model | Well-hill are dual | They're the same structure at different ages. |

**Core insight:**

> The hill and the well are not alternatives.
> The hill is the surface of a well that has been filled with radiation.
> Young structures are wells. Mature structures are hills.
> The Space-Ball is both, simultaneously.
