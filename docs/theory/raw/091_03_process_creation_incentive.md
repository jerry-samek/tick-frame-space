# **Processes Have an Incentive to Create New Processes**
### *A concise formulation in the language of the Gamma Hill Model*

In the Gamma Hill Model, every process contributes an imprint to the gamma‑gradient.  
This imprint:

- raises the hill when coherent,
- lowers or roughens it when dissipative,
- and interacts with other imprints through lag compatibility.

Because **hill height corresponds to available energy**, and because **energy increases with imprint coherence**, processes gain a direct geometric advantage by contributing to a shared rising hill.

From this follows a fundamental incentive:

> **A process increases its own energetic capacity by generating additional compatible processes.**

This is not biological, social, or moral.  
It is purely geometric:

- More processes → more imprints
- More imprints → stronger cooperative gradients
- Stronger gradients → higher hill
- Higher hill → more energy for all contributing processes

Thus, the creation of new processes is the most efficient way to:

- amplify hill height,
- reduce residual,
- increase compatibility,
- and stabilize the system against collapse.

In this framework, **proliferation is not an accident of evolution**.  
It is a natural consequence of the geometry:

> **Processes that generate new processes rise.  
> Processes that remain isolated fall.**

This is the deep incentive structure embedded in the gamma field itself.
