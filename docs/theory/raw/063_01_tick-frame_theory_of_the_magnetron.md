# **Tick‑Frame Theory of the Magnetron**

*A unified pattern–gamma interpretation and predictions for simulation validation*

---

## **1. Overview**

In the tick‑frame universe, all physical interactions emerge from two primitives:

- **Patterns** — discrete entities carrying load and energy.
- **Gamma field** — the local rate of time flow, derived from capacity\(_\text{eff}\).

Classical electromagnetic forces do not exist as fundamental entities.  
Instead:

> **Electric fields = gradients in gamma**  
> **Magnetic fields = anisotropies in gamma caused by moving or rotating patterns**

A magnetron is therefore:

> **A self‑excited oscillatory system where a rotating electron pattern pumps energy into resonant gamma modes defined
by cavity geometry.**

| Classical Concept       | Tick‑Frame Equivalent                             |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Cathode                 | Massive static pattern creating a deep gamma‑well |
| Anode with cavities     | Structured pattern shaping gamma modes            |
| Electric field (radial) | Radial gamma gradient                             |
| Magnetic field (axial)  | Axial gamma anisotropy (usměrněné gamma pole)     |
| Electron trajectories   | Motion of light patterns in gamma geometry        |
| Space charge wheel      | Stable rotating pattern in a gamma‑well           |
| Microwave oscillation   | Standing gamma‑mode excited by rotating patterns  |

## **3. Tick‑Frame Magnetron Mechanism**

### **3.1 Static Gamma Geometry (Cathode + Anode)**

- Cathode and anode are heavy patterns.
- They generate a **static gamma‑well** with a radial gradient.
- Cavities in the anode create **localized resonant gamma modes** (analogous to RF cavities).

### **3.2 Crossed‑Gamma Configuration**

A magnetron requires two gamma components:

1. **Radial gamma gradient**  
   Drives electrons outward (analog of electric field).

2. **Axial gamma anisotropy**  
   Deflects moving electrons sideways (analog of magnetic field).

Together, these create **spiral orbits** instead of straight trajectories.

### **3.3 Formation of the Space Charge Wheel**

Electrons emitted from the cathode:

- accelerate outward due to the gamma gradient,
- are deflected azimuthally by gamma anisotropy,
- settle into a **stable rotating ring** at a characteristic radius.

This ring is a **rotating pattern**, which itself induces further gamma anisotropy.

### **3.4 Excitation of Cavity Gamma Modes**

As the rotating electron pattern passes cavity openings:

- it periodically modulates the gamma field,
- injecting energy into cavity modes,
- which grow until reaching a steady oscillation.

This is the tick‑frame analog of **microwave generation**.

### **3.5 Self‑Excited Oscillation**

The system reaches equilibrium when:

- energy input from the rotating pattern
  =  
- energy radiated by the cavity gamma mode.

This produces a stable, coherent oscillation.

## **4. Predictions for Tick‑Frame Simulation**

These predictions are testable in your existing framework.

---

### **Prediction 1: Formation of a Rotating Electron Ring**

**Setup:**

- Central cathode pattern
- Circular anode pattern with cavity gaps
- Radial gamma gradient
- Axial gamma anisotropy

**Expected Result:**

- Electrons form a **stable rotating ring** at a predictable radius.
- Below a threshold anisotropy → electrons hit the anode.
- Above a threshold → electrons remain trapped near the cathode.

---

### **Prediction 2: Frequency Locking to Cavity Gamma Modes**

**Setup:**

- Same geometry as above
- Measure gamma oscillations inside cavities

**Expected Result:**

- After transient chaos, a **single dominant oscillation frequency** emerges.
- This frequency matches the cavity’s geometric resonance.

---

### **Prediction 3: DC → AC Conversion**

**Setup:**

- Constant energy input at cathode (DC)
- Track energy in cavity gamma modes

**Expected Result:**

- Electron kinetic energy decreases over time
- Cavity gamma‑mode energy increases
- System stabilizes into a **self‑excited oscillation**

---

### **Prediction 4: Dependence on Gamma Anisotropy Strength**

**Setup:**

- Sweep anisotropy parameter
- Measure:
    - ring stability
    - rotation frequency
    - cavity mode amplitude

**Expected Result:**

- There exists an **optimal anisotropy window**:
    - too weak → diode behavior
    - too strong → electrons trapped near cathode
    - optimal → maximum cavity excitation

---

## **5. Interpretation**

The tick‑frame magnetron demonstrates:

- No need for Maxwell equations as fundamental laws
- Magnetism emerges from **anisotropic gamma geometry**
- Oscillations emerge from **pattern–gamma feedback loops**
- Classical microwave generation is a **special case of gamma‑mode resonance**

This unifies:

- electromagnetism,
- resonance,
- and pattern dynamics

under a single computational ontology.
