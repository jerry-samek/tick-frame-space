## **Abstract**

This document formalizes the principle that **gravity is not a force**, **not curvature**, and **not interaction**, but an **energetic optimization process** arising from the structure of the expanding gamma field.

Objects do not attract each other.  
Instead, **smaller processes migrate into regions where maintaining their imprint is cheaper**.  
Large objects create deep, stable gamma wakes that reduce the energetic cost of existence for nearby processes.  
This produces the phenomenology traditionally interpreted as gravitational attraction.

This principle unifies:

- gravitational acceleration
- orbital stability
- mass‑dependence
- the 1/r² law
- the behavior of photons (RAW‑081)
- the emergence of dark matter (RAW‑009)

without invoking forces, curvature, or exotic particles.

## **1. Foundations**

### **1.1 Gamma Field Expansion**

The gamma field expands outward every tick.  
All processes with nonzero tick budget are carried along by this expansion.

### **1.2 Imprint Cost**

Every process must maintain a **gamma imprint** to remain representable in the substrate.  
This requires tick‑budget expenditure.

The deeper the imprint:

- the more stable the process
- the more expensive it is to maintain
- the stronger its influence on the local gamma geometry

### **1.3 Wake Formation**

A large, stable process creates a **gamma wake**:

- a region of reduced expansion drift
- a region where imprint maintenance is cheaper
- a region of lower energetic curvature

This wake is not a field emitted by the object.  
It is a **structural consequence** of its imprint resisting expansion.

## **2. The Gravity Principle**

### **2.1 Statement of the Principle**

> **Gravity is the emergent tendency of smaller processes to migrate into regions where the energetic cost of maintaining their imprint is minimized within the expanding gamma field.**

Large objects do not pull.  
Small objects **optimize**.

### **2.2 No Force, No Curvature**

There is:

- no attractive force
- no interaction
- no exchange
- no curvature of space

Instead, there is:

- a gradient of imprint cost
- created by the wake of a large object
- into which smaller objects naturally drift

### **2.3 Energetic Gradient**

Let \( C(x) \) be the cost of maintaining an imprint at position \( x \).

Then gravitational acceleration is:

\[
a = -\nabla C(x)
\]

This is not a force law.  
It is a **cost‑minimization gradient**.

---

## **3. Consequences**

### **3.1 Free Fall**

A small object in free fall is simply:

- moving along the steepest descent of imprint cost
- minimizing its tick‑budget expenditure
- following the gamma‑wake gradient

### **3.2 Orbits**

An orbit is:

- a local minimum of the cost landscape
- where lateral drift balances radial cost gradient
- producing a stable, periodic solution

No force is required.  
Orbit = **energetic equilibrium**.

### **3.3 Mass Dependence**

Large objects have deeper wakes because:

- they invest more tick budget
- their imprint is stronger
- their resistance to expansion is greater

Thus:

\[
C(x) \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
\]

The 1/r² law emerges automatically from spherical expansion geometry.

### **3.4 Photons (RAW‑081)**

Photons:

- do not expand with the gamma field
- spend their entire tick budget countering expansion
- have no imprint
- therefore do not experience gravitational cost gradients
- but their **path is shaped by the gamma geometry itself**

This reproduces gravitational lensing without mass or force.

## **4. Formal Model**

### **4.1 Imprint Cost Function**

Let:

- \( I \) = imprint depth
- \( E \) = tick‑budget expenditure
- \( \gamma(x) \) = local expansion rate

Then:

\[
C(x) = E - I \cdot \gamma(x)
\]

Large objects reduce \( \gamma(x) \) in their wake.  
Thus \( C(x) \) is lower near them.

### **4.2 Wake Geometry**

For a spherically symmetric object:

\[
\gamma(r) = \gamma_0 - \frac{k}{r^2}
\]

Thus:

\[
C(r) = C_0 - \frac{kI}{r^2}
\]

This reproduces Newtonian gravity as a **cost gradient**, not a force.

### **4.3 Motion Equation**

A process moves according to:

\[
\frac{dx}{dt} = -\nabla C(x)
\]

This is the fundamental gravitational equation in the gamma‑field ontology.

## **5. Interpretation**

### **5.1 Gravity as Economics**

Gravity is the **economics of existence**:

- objects seek cheaper regions
- wakes provide discounts
- expansion provides pressure
- cost gradients produce motion

### **5.2 No Action at a Distance**

Everything is local:

- the gamma field expands
- objects resist expansion
- resistance creates local gradients
- gradients guide nearby objects

### **5.3 No Parasitism**

Large objects do not exploit small ones.  
Small objects exploit the **cheaper environment** created by large ones.

This is the correct direction of asymmetry.

## **6. Relationship to Other RAW Documents**

- **RAW‑049** — Time as substrate; expansion as fundamental
- **RAW‑081** — Photon as degenerate process (no imprint)
- **RAW‑009** — Dark matter as non‑intersecting imprints
- **RAW‑082** — Gravity as cost‑gradient optimization (this document)

---

## **7. Summary**

Gravity is not a force.  
It is not curvature.  
It is not interaction.

It is:

> **The emergent drift of processes into regions where maintaining their imprint requires the least tick‑budget expenditure, caused by the gamma‑wake of larger processes resisting expansion.**

This principle explains:

- free fall
- orbits
- mass dependence
- 1/r² law
- photon behavior
- dark matter
- cosmological structure

within a single, unified, substrate‑level ontology.
