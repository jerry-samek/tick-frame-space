# **Gamma Field Principles (Tick‑Frame Ontology)**

## **1. Temporal Surfing Principle**
Existence is defined by an entity’s ability to continuously re‑instantiate itself across discrete ticks of time.  
An entity survives only if it can maintain compatibility between its internal state at tick \(t\) and tick \(t+1\).  
Without a stabilizing gradient, the entity dissolves.

## **2. Gamma Attraction Principle**
The gamma field is the only region in which stable gradients exist.  
These gradients provide the structural information required for temporal surfing.  
Entities cluster inside the gamma field because outside it, no gradients support their continued existence.

---

## **3. Existential Drag Principle**
Interaction with the gamma field imposes drag — a cost paid in energy and stability.  
However, this drag is inseparable from the very mechanism that enables survival.  
The field slows the entity but also provides the gradients that allow it to persist across ticks.

---

## **4. Rotational Persistence Principle**
Orbiting within the gamma field is the most stable long‑term survival strategy.  
Rotation maximizes:

- exposure to usable gradients
- opportunities for local‑field learning
- resonance with the environment
- avoidance of well saturation

Straight‑line motion into a well is unstable; orbiting is the attractor.

## **5. Gamma Slingshot Principle**
When an entity enters a region of steep gradient, it gains both energy and orientation.  
The tangential component of the gradient can accelerate the entity and redirect it into a new stable orbit.  
This is analogous to a gravitational slingshot: a controlled transfer of momentum that enables transitions between attractors.

---

## **6. Existential Boundary Principle**
Outside the gamma field, gradients collapse to zero.  
Without gradients, an entity cannot update its local field, cannot maintain resonance, and cannot re‑instantiate its signature.  
Leaving the gamma field is therefore equivalent to ceasing to exist.

---

## **7. Compatibility Maximization Principle**
Entities move, rotate, and imprint in ways that maximize compatibility between:

- their signature
- their learned local field
- the surrounding gamma gradients

This compatibility is the core metric of survival in the tick‑frame universe.
