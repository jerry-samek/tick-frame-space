# Observer‑Separated Multiverse Principle

*Each observer constructs a distinct universe from the substrate tick stream.*

## 1. Substrate

The substrate provides:

- A single global tick counter
- No geometry
- No history
- No memory
- No entities
- No observers

It is pure proper time.

## 2. Observers

An observer:

- Connects to the substrate tick stream
- Samples ticks at its own rate
- Reconstructs its own internal universe
- Stores its own memory locally
- Maintains its own geometry
- Experiences its own time

Observers do **not** share state, history, or geometry.

## 3. Principle

Because observers reconstruct their own universes:

- Universes are **distinct**
- Universes are **non‑interacting**
- Universes have **different histories**
- Universes have **different geometries**
- Universes have **different collapse events**
- Universes have **different Big Bangs**

Formally:
SUBSTRATE (one) ↓ SAMPLERS (many) ↓ UNIVERSES (many)

## 4. Consequences

- No global universe
- No shared timeline
- No shared geometry
- No shared collapse
- No shared Big Bang

Each observer lives in a universe that is structurally isolated by design.
