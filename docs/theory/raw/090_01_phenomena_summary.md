## 🧠 Interpretation & Implications

- **The ontology reframes inertia** as a dynamic, lag-dependent property—offering a potential explanation for anomalies
  like the Tajmar effect, where gyroscopes near rotating cryostats exhibit unexplained accelerations.
- **Charge drift** as lag-flow reorientation could provide a geometric basis for CP violation, which remains one of the
  deepest puzzles in particle physics.
- **Gamma-field turbulence** aligns with recent work on spontaneous stochasticity in fluid dynamics, where turbulence
  exhibits chaotic behavior not fully captured by Navier–Stokes equations.
- **Residual thermodynamics** offers a new lens on heat transport anomalies in low-dimensional and topological
  materials, where classical models fail.
- **Subcritical well condensation** could model vacuum fluctuations and spontaneous particle creation, phenomena
  currently treated probabilistically in quantum field theory.
