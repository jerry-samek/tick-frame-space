## Relative Decay Principle
*A model is valid if it is internally consistent, falsifiable, and explanatory, regardless of its alignment with current physical dogma.*

*The significance of an entity’s wave‑time decreases as the universe ages, because the same natural‑number energy interval represents a smaller fraction of total existence.*

### Explanation
In a tick‑frame universe, energy is not an absolute quantity.
It is simply the number of ticks an entity persists in the wave phase:

\[
E = o - b
\]

But the **meaning** of that energy depends on the universe’s age \(U\).
A raw energy of 1 tick at:

- **tick 1** → represents the entire age of the universe
- **tick 1000** → represents only 1/1000 of the universe’s age
- **tick 1,000,000** → becomes cosmically negligible

Thus, without using fractions or continuous decay curves, the universe naturally exhibits:

- cosmic cooling
- effective energy dilution
- shortening half‑times
- age‑dependent stability

All emerging from pure natural numbers.

---

### Motivation
This principle arises from the desire to keep the substrate **fully discrete**, **integer‑based**, and **falsifiable**, while still capturing the intuitive behavior of a universe that “cools” and “thins out” over time.

Instead of introducing floating‑point decay, exponential functions, or continuous mathematics, the model relies on the simplest possible ingredients:

- birth tick
- observation tick
- universe age

From these three integers, the universe naturally produces:

- early‑universe hyper‑energetic behavior
- late‑universe fragility
- diminishing significance of fixed wave‑time
- a discrete analogue of half‑life decay

This preserves the elegance of the substrate while allowing complex emergent behavior.

---

### Consequences
The Relative Decay Principle has several important implications for the dynamics of the universe:

- **Early entities dominate**
  Entities observed in early ticks have disproportionately high effective energy.

- **Late entities are fragile**
  The same raw wave‑time yields far less significance as the universe grows older.

- **Binding becomes harder over time**
  Composite structures require more raw ticks to achieve the same effective stability.

- **Dimensional transitions become time‑dependent**
  Higher‑dimensional entities require more wave‑time relative to the universe’s age.

- **Entropy naturally increases**
  As effective energy shrinks, collapse becomes more common, raising entropy without explicit decay mechanics.

- **Half‑time emerges automatically**
  The midpoint between birth and observation defines the entity’s effective “center of existence,” and its relevance shrinks as the universe expands.

This principle ensures that the universe evolves in a way that feels physically intuitive while remaining strictly discrete and integer‑driven.

---

### Example
Consider two entities with the **same raw wave‑time**:

- Entity A: born at tick 1, observed at tick 2
- Entity B: born at tick 999, observed at tick 1000

Both have:

\[
E = o - b = 1
\]

But their **effective significance** is radically different.

#### Early Universe (tick 2)
- Universe age \(U = 2\)
- Energy \(E = 1\)
- Effective fraction = 1/2 of all existence
- Entity A is cosmically “heavy,” highly stable, and influential.

#### Late Universe (tick 1000)
- Universe age \(U = 1000\)
- Energy \(E = 1\)
- Effective fraction = 1/1000 of all existence
- Entity B is cosmically “light,” fragile, and easily collapses.

Even though both entities lived exactly one tick in the wave phase, the **Relative Decay Principle** ensures their effective energy differs by orders of magnitude — without using fractions, floats, or continuous decay.

This demonstrates how the universe naturally “cools” and how half‑life‑like decay emerges from pure natural numbers.

### ASCII Diagram: Relative Decay Over Universe Age

Below, two entities each accumulate **1 tick of wave‑time** before observation.  
The universe ages from **U = 2** to **U = 1000**.  
The same raw energy becomes a smaller and smaller fraction of total existence.
