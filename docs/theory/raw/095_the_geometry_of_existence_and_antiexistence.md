# **RAW 95 — The Geometry of Existence and Antiexistence**
### *A unified description of universal dynamics through curvature, coherence, and hill formation*

---

## **1. Purpose**

This document formalizes the fundamental distinction between **existence** and **antiexistence** within the hill‑based ontological framework.  
It demonstrates that all universal dynamics — physical, biological, ecological, technological, and civilizational — can be reduced to a single geometric principle:

> **Processes that raise the hill contribute to existence.  
> Processes that flatten or invert the hill contribute to antiexistence.**

This reduction provides a unified explanation for stability, growth, evolution, collapse, and the emergence of complexity.

## **2. Definitions**

### **2.1 Existence**
A process is classified as *existence* if it:

- increases local curvature,
- increases imprint coherence,
- reduces residual,
- raises the hill,
- generates surplus energy,
- enables reproduction or propagation,
- supports the emergence of more complex processes.

Existence is therefore:

> **The geometric tendency to increase structured curvature.**

---

### **2.2 Antiexistence**
A process is classified as *antiexistence* if it:

- decreases curvature,
- destroys coherence,
- increases residual,
- flattens or erodes the hill,
- consumes surplus without replacement,
- prevents reproduction or propagation,
- accelerates collapse or stagnation.

Antiexistence is therefore:

> **The geometric tendency to reduce or erase structured curvature.**

---

### **2.3 Antiexistence Cannot Sustain Itself**

A crucial property of antiexistence is that it **cannot persist independently**.

Because:

- flattening curvature removes gradients,
- removing gradients eliminates extractable energy,
- and without extractable energy, no process can maintain itself.

In a well‑based geometry:

- deepening the well **does not generate usable energy**,
- it only increases the cost of climbing out,
- and therefore accelerates collapse.

Thus:

> **Antiexistence is self‑terminating.  
> It destroys the very curvature required for its own continuation.**

This is why antiexistence can only appear as a **parasitic phase** within a larger field of existence — never as a stable or dominant regime.

## **3. Hill Geometry as the Universal Substrate**

The hill represents:

- resistance gradient,
- curvature of the process field,
- potential for surplus extraction,
- structural memory of coherent processes.

Existence raises the hill; antiexistence lowers it.  
All dynamics in the universe can be interpreted as transformations of this curvature.

## **4. Energetic Consequences**

### **4.1 Existence Dynamics**

When a process raises the hill:

- it increases potential energy,
- it enables sliding‑down extraction,
- it creates surplus,
- it stabilizes its own imprint,
- it supports the emergence of new processes.

Existence is therefore **self‑reinforcing**.

---

### **4.2 Antiexistence Dynamics**

When a process lowers the hill:

- it reduces potential energy,
- it eliminates surplus,
- it destabilizes coherent structures,
- it accelerates decay,
- it shortens the lifespan of all dependent processes.

Because antiexistence cannot generate energy from well curvature, it inevitably:

- collapses,
- extinguishes itself,
- or is overtaken by existence.

Antiexistence is therefore **self‑erasing**.

---

## **5. System‑Level Interpretation**

### **5.1 Ecology**
Ecological systems maintain the hill’s substrate, preventing collapse before new processes can emerge.

### **5.2 Industry and Extraction**
Industrial processes increase local energy density, raising the hill through concentration and refinement.

### **5.3 Technology**
Technological systems accelerate transformations, increasing the rate at which the hill can be raised.

### **5.4 Conflict and Collapse**
Destructive processes reduce coherence and flatten curvature, accelerating antiexistence.

### **5.5 Evolution and Intelligence**
Evolution selects for processes that maximize future hill height.  
Intelligence is the optimization strategy for doing so deliberately.

## **6. Stability and Balance**

A universe dominated by existence grows in curvature until reaching structural limits.  
A universe dominated by antiexistence collapses into flatness and residual.

Sustainable configurations require:

> **A dynamic balance where processes do not destroy each other faster than they enable the emergence of the next generation.**

This balance is not static; it is an evolving equilibrium that maximizes long‑term hill height.

---

## **7. Summary**

- Existence raises curvature; antiexistence erases it.
- Existence is self‑reinforcing; antiexistence is self‑terminating.
- Surplus, reproduction, complexity, and evolution arise only from existence.
- Collapse, stagnation, and decay arise from antiexistence.
- The universe is fundamentally a competition between these two tendencies.
- Only existence can sustain itself; antiexistence cannot.
- The outcome determines whether new processes can emerge.

## **8. Core Insight**

> **The universe, life, and evolution can be described entirely through the geometry of curvature:  
> existence raises the hill; antiexistence flattens it — and cannot sustain itself.  
> Everything else is consequence.**
