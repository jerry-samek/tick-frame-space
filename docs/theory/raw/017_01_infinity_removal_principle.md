# Discrete Time–Space Model: Velocity and Relativistic Effects

*(Extended with Infinity Removal Principle)*

---

## ♾️ Infinity Removal and Substrate Perspective

### Substrate as Singleton

* The substrate operates as a **consecutive singleton process**: one tick after another, without gaps.
* It does not require infinity to function; it simply advances deterministically at the Planck‑tick scale.
* Infinity is not a structural property of the substrate — it is a visualization artifact that emerges when equations
  extrapolate beyond causal horizons.

### Relativity Without Infinity

* In continuous relativity, singularities (e.g., black holes, Big Bang) appear as infinities in equations.
* In the discrete tick‑frame model, these infinities are replaced by **finite tick horizons**:
    * **Black holes:** collapse is bounded by the maximum tick density; beyond the horizon, visualization ceases rather
      than diverging to infinity.
    * **Big Bang:** the origin is simply the first tick, not an infinite singularity.
* Relativistic effects (time dilation, length contraction) remain valid, but they emerge from **frame aggregation
  artifacts**, not infinite values.

### Visualization of Infinity

* Observers can *render* infinity by aggregating ticks into frames that appear unbounded.
* This is a perceptual illusion: the substrate itself only runs consecutive ticks.
* Infinity exists only in the **representation layer**, not in the substrate.

## ✅ Extended Takeaway

* The **substrate is finite and consecutive**, operating as a singleton tick engine.
* **Infinity is a visualization artifact**, not a substrate reality.
* Relativity effects are preserved without requiring infinities, emerging naturally from mismatches between tick‑level
  causality and frame‑level rendering.
* This resolves singularities by grounding them in finite tick horizons, making the model both auditable and physically
  coherent.
