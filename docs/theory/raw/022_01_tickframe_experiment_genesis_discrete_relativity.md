# Tick-Frame Experiments

### *Revised to incorporate the Substrate Law and Adjacency Principle*

The original experiments (Genesis, Discrete Relativity, Drift of π, etc.) were designed before the Substrate Law and
Adjacency Principle were fully articulated.  
This chapter updates each experiment so it aligns with the new understanding:

- no forces
- no geometry
- no fields
- no constants
- only ticks + adjacency + local update rules
- everything else is a reconstruction

Each experiment now explicitly states:

1. **Substrate‑level behavior**
2. **Observer‑level reconstruction**
3. **Expected drift or emergent phenomena**
4. **What the experiment falsifies or confirms**

# ✅ 1. Genesis Experiment (Updated)

## **Purpose**

To observe how adjacency patterns expand under the Substrate Law and how the observer reconstructs this as “cosmic
expansion.”

## **Substrate‑Level Description**

\[
A(t+1) = U(A(t))
\]

Where \(U\) produces:

- adjacency growth
- new reachable nodes
- expanding causal frontier

No geometry.  
No space.  
No expansion.  
Just adjacency growth.

## **Observer Reconstruction**

The observer interprets:

- adjacency frontier → horizon
- adjacency density → matter distribution
- adjacency growth → expansion of space
- adjacency drift → cosmological constant

## **Expected Results**

- the horizon grows monotonically
- effective Λ(t) drifts
- large‑scale structure emerges from adjacency clustering

## **Falsification Condition**

If adjacency growth does not produce a monotonic horizon, the Substrate Law is incomplete.

# ✅ 2. Discrete Relativity Experiment (Updated)

## **Purpose**

To show that relativistic effects emerge from adjacency constraints, not geometry.

## **Substrate‑Level Description**

Propagation speed is limited by adjacency transitions:

\[
c(t) = 1 \text{ step/tick}
\]

No spacetime.  
No Lorentz symmetry.  
Just adjacency update limits.

## **Observer Reconstruction**

The observer interprets:

- max adjacency speed → speed of light
- adjacency path distortion → time dilation
- adjacency density → curvature

## **Expected Results**

- Lorentz‑like effects appear in reconstructed space
- time dilation emerges from adjacency congestion
- curvature emerges from adjacency deviation

## **Falsification Condition**

If reconstructed motion does not show Lorentz‑like behavior, adjacency constraints are insufficient.

---

# ✅ 3. Drift of π Experiment (Updated)

## **Purpose**

To measure how discrete adjacency geometry produces a scale‑dependent π.

## **Substrate‑Level Description**

Circles are adjacency shells:

\[
\pi(t, R) = \frac{O_{\text{disc}}(t, R)}{D_{\text{disc}}(t, R)}
\]

No geometry.  
No Euclidean space.  
Just adjacency shells.

## **Observer Reconstruction**

The observer interprets:

- adjacency shells → circles
- adjacency counts → distances
- drift of π → geometric distortion

## **Expected Results**

- π(t, R) approaches 3.14159… only as R → large
- π(t, R) drifts with horizon
- π(t) is not constant

## **Falsification Condition**

If π(t, R) is constant across scales, adjacency is not discrete.

---

# ✅ 4. Drift of Constants Experiment (Updated)

## **Purpose**

To measure how classical constants emerge as summaries of adjacency behavior.

## **Substrate‑Level Description**

Constants are functions:

\[
K(t) = f_K(A(t), H(t))
\]

## **Observer Reconstruction**

The observer interprets:

- stable adjacency patterns → constants
- drift → cosmological evolution

## **Expected Results**

- α(t), G(t), h(t), Λ(t) drift
- drift correlates with horizon growth
- drift is slow and scale‑dependent

## **Falsification Condition**

If constants remain perfectly fixed, the observer’s reconstruction is not scale‑sensitive.

---

# ✅ 5. Particle Identity Experiment (Updated)

## **Purpose**

To show that particles are stable adjacency loops, not fundamental objects.

## **Substrate‑Level Description**

Particles = repeating adjacency motifs:

\[
\text{Particle}(t) = \text{Loop}(A(t))
\]

## **Observer Reconstruction**

The observer interprets:

- stable loops → particles
- loop tension → mass
- loop bias → charge
- loop locking → strong force

## **Expected Results**

- stable adjacency loops persist
- loops interact via adjacency bias
- identity is emergent, not stored

## **Falsification Condition**

If loops cannot remain stable, particles cannot emerge.

---

# ✅ 6. Entropy & Horizon Experiment (Updated)

## **Purpose**

To show that entropy increases because the adjacency frontier grows.

## **Substrate‑Level Description**

\[
S(t) = k_B(t)\,\ln \Omega(t)
\]

Where:

- \(\Omega(t)\) = reachable adjacency states
- horizon growth increases \(\Omega(t)\)

## **Observer Reconstruction**

The observer interprets:

- more adjacency states → more entropy
- horizon growth → arrow of time

## **Expected Results**

- entropy increases monotonically
- entropy correlates with horizon size

## **Falsification Condition**

If entropy decreases while horizon grows, reconstruction is inconsistent.

---

# ✅ 7. Force Collapse Experiment (New)

## **Purpose**

To demonstrate that the four forces are not fundamental.

## **Substrate‑Level Description**

All interactions are reduced to:

\[
\Delta x(t+1) = \Delta x(t) + \text{AdjacencyBias}(t)
\]

## **Observer Reconstruction**

The observer interprets:

- bias → force
- adjacency deviation → gravity
- adjacency rotation → electromagnetism
- adjacency locking → strong force
- adjacency reconfiguration → weak force

## **Expected Results**

- all “forces” reduce to adjacency bias
- no separate force laws are needed

## **Falsification Condition**

If any interaction cannot be expressed as adjacency bias, the Substrate Law is incomplete.

---

# ✅ 8. Summary

These updated experiments now:

- align with the Substrate Law
- incorporate the Adjacency Principle
- use tick‑dependent equations
- treat forces as reconstructions
- treat constants as driftable
- treat geometry as emergent
- treat particles as adjacency loops

They form a complete experimental suite for validating the tick‑frame universe.
