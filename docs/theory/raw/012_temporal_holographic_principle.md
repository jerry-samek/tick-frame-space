# Temporal Holographic Principle

## 1. Statement

> The present tick encodes all past events as embedded artefacts, accessible to agents but not reactivatable.  
> Just as the holographic principle encodes spatial bulk information on a boundary surface, the temporal holographic
> principle encodes historical bulk information in the current tick’s embedded memory.

| Dimension            | Holographic Principle                            | Temporal Holographic Principle                                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encoding surface** | 2D boundary of space                             | Current tick (PoF commit)                                             |
| **Bulk reality**     | 3D universe emerges from boundary data           | Continuous perception emerges from discrete tick + embedded artefacts |
| **History**          | Bulk states are projections of boundary encoding | Past states are projections of artefacts embedded in present tick     |
| **Observation**      | Agents perceive bulk as holographic projection   | Agents perceive “past” by reading artefacts tagged in current tick    |

## 3. Mechanism

1. **Emission at collapse (PoF):**  
   Each tick commits state and emits artefacts (photons, waves, information packets).

2. **Propagation:**  
   Artefacts travel causally through the substrate (retarded Green’s functions, transport equations).

3. **Embedding:**  
   Current tick contains artefacts from all past ticks, tagged with provenance (TickID, emission time, invariants).

4. **Observation:**  
   Agents read embedded artefacts → interpret them as “past events.”  
   This is equivalent to reading holographic boundary data to reconstruct bulk.

## 4. Implications

- **No ontological past:** History is not reactivatable; only present tick exists.
- **Auditability:** Artefacts carry tags, ensuring provenance and traceability.
- **Perception of past:** Agents see embedded artefacts, not past states.
- **Temporal holography:** The present tick acts as a “boundary surface” encoding all historical information.

## 5. Scientific Parallels

- **Holographic principle (’t Hooft, Susskind):**  
  Information in a volume is encoded on its boundary surface.
- **AdS/CFT correspondence:**  
  Bulk spacetime ↔ boundary conformal field theory.
- **Collapse models:**  
  Discrete events (PoF) emit artefacts that persist in continuous substrate.
- **Causal set theory:**  
  Spacetime as discrete events with causal order, consistent with Lorentz invariance.

## 7. Conclusion

The **Temporal Holographic Principle** reframes holography in the time domain:

- The **current tick** is the encoding surface.
- **Past events** are artefacts embedded in the present.
- **Observation of history** is reading embedded artefacts, not accessing past states.

This principle unifies your tick/log framework with holographic universe theory, showing that both spatial and temporal
holography are consistent descriptions of how information is encoded and projected in reality.
