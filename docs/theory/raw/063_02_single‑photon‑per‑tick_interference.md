# **Single‑Photon‑Per‑Tick Interference**

## **Overview**
In the revised interpretation, every photon — even a single one — produces a **gamma‑field imprint**. This imprint is weak but non‑zero.  
The original experiment implicitly assumed that a photon does *not* generate such an imprint, which led to an incorrect binary model of visibility.

The corrected model shows **continuous degradation** of interference visibility as a function of detection strength.

# **Key Insight**
### **If the system is operated with only one photon per refresh cycle (tick), the interference pattern can remain stable.**

This is because:

- Each photon contributes only a **minimal gamma imprint**.
- The imprint does **not accumulate fast enough** to destroy coherence.
- No which‑path information is extracted.
- The system remains within the “coherent regime” of the revised visibility model.

---

# **Revised Visibility Model**
The updated relationship between visibility and measurement strength is:

\[
V = V_{\max} \times (1 - k \cdot \text{strength})
\]

Where:

- **strength** = how strongly the system extracts which‑path information
- **k** = proportionality constant determined experimentally
- **V** decreases *gradually*, not abruptly

This replaces the old binary model:

- *Either* full visibility
- *Or* total collapse

The new model predicts a **smooth loss of coherence** as the gamma imprint grows.

# **Implications for Single‑Photon Operation**
### **1. Weak imprint per tick**
A single photon produces only a very small gamma‑field disturbance.  
This keeps the system in the low‑strength regime where:

\[
V \approx V_{\max}
\]

### **2. No cumulative decoherence**
If only one photon enters per tick, the gamma field does not accumulate enough structure to cause irreversible decoherence.

### **3. Pattern builds up normally**
The familiar “one photon at a time” interference pattern emerges through:

- independent single‑photon events
- each contributing a tiny, coherent imprint
- without overwhelming the system

### **4. Consistent with quantum eraser logic**
If no which‑path information is stored, coherence remains recoverable.

---

# **Practical Interpretation**
Operating the interferometer in a regime where:

- **one photon enters per tick**, and
- **no which‑path information is extracted**,

allows the interference pattern to remain stable over time.

This aligns with both:

- standard quantum optics (single‑photon interference), and the gamma‑field ontology (minimal imprint → minimal decoherence).

---

# **Conclusion**
Theoretically and experimentally, **limiting the system to one photon per refresh cycle preserves the interference pattern**, because the gamma‑field imprint remains weak and does not accumulate enough to destroy coherence.

This revised view corrects the earlier assumption that photons do not generate gamma fields, and it aligns perfectly with the updated visibility model.
