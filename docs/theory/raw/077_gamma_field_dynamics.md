# **Gamma Field Dynamics in Tick‑Frame Ontology**
### *A Formal Specification of Waves, Attractors, Entity Survival, and Well Propagation*

## **1. Introduction**
This document formalizes the behavior of entities, gradients, waves, and attractors within a tick‑frame universe governed by a gamma field. It describes how existence is maintained, how compatibility gradients propagate, and how wells influence the field. Waves and well‑strength propagation emerge naturally from field expansion without requiring explicit propagation mechanisms.

# **2. Temporal Foundations**

## **2.1 Temporal Surfing Principle**
Existence is defined by an entity’s ability to maintain compatibility between its internal state at tick \(t\) and tick \(t+1\).  
An entity survives only if it can successfully re‑instantiate itself across ticks.  
Without a stabilizing gradient, the entity dissolves.

## **2.2 Present‑State Realism**
Only the current gamma field is ontologically real.  
All interpretations of past ticks are reconstructed from the present field configuration.

# **3. Gamma Field Structure**

## **3.1 Gamma Attraction Principle**
The gamma field is the sole region containing stable gradients that support temporal surfing.  
Entities cluster within the gamma field because outside it, no gradients exist to sustain their continued existence.

## **3.2 Existential Boundary Principle**
Outside the gamma field, gradients collapse to zero.  
Without gradients, an entity cannot update its local field, maintain resonance, or re‑instantiate its signature.  
Leaving the gamma field is equivalent to ceasing to exist.

# **4. Entity Dynamics**

## **4.1 Existential Drag Principle**
Interaction with the gamma field imposes drag — a cost in energy and stability.  
However, this drag is inseparable from the mechanism that enables survival.  
The field slows the entity but simultaneously provides the gradients required for persistence.

## **4.2 Rotational Persistence Principle**
Orbiting within the gamma field is the most stable long‑term survival strategy.  
Rotation maximizes:

- exposure to usable gradients
- opportunities for local‑field learning
- resonance stability
- avoidance of well saturation

Straight‑line motion into a well is unstable; orbiting is the natural attractor.

## **4.3 Compatibility Maximization Principle**
Entities adapt their motion, imprint, and orientation to maximize compatibility between:

- their internal signature
- their learned local field
- the surrounding gamma gradients

Compatibility is the core metric of survival.

# **5. Attractors and Waves**

## **5.1 Attractor Gradient Principle**
Attractors generate regions of high compatibility.  
These regions form gradient basins that guide entities toward stable orbits.

## **5.2 Expansion‑Driven Propagation Principle**
Waves do not require a dedicated propagation mechanism.  
They emerge naturally as compatibility gradients expand due to:

- field decay
- diffusion
- smoothing
- normalization
- spatial relaxation

In an expanding or relaxing field, any imprint or attractor automatically spreads outward.

## **5.3 Wave–Attractor Coupling Principle**
Waves are the outward expansion of an attractor’s influence.  
They form navigational paths that entities follow because they locally increase compatibility and survival probability.

## **5.4 Gamma Slingshot Principle**
When an entity enters a region of steep gradient, it gains energy and orientation.  
The tangential component of the gradient can accelerate the entity and redirect it into a new stable orbit.  
This is analogous to a gravitational slingshot: a momentum transfer enabling transitions between attractors.

# **6. Well Strength Propagation**

## **6.1 Attractor Influence as a Field Gradient**
A gamma well is a region of high compatibility created by repeated imprinting or structural reinforcement.  
Its “strength” is a gradient distribution extending outward from the well’s center.

## **6.2 Expansion‑Driven Well Propagation**
Well strength spreads outward as a natural consequence of the gamma field’s evolution.  
No special mechanism is required; propagation is driven by:

- decay
- diffusion
- smoothing
- normalization
- spatial relaxation

Thus, well propagation is the outward expansion of the attractor’s compatibility gradient.

## **6.3 Gradient Basin Formation**
As the well’s influence spreads, it forms a gradient basin — a region where compatibility increases monotonically toward the well center.  
Entities detect this basin through rising resonance and improved local‑field alignment.

## **6.4 Waves as Well Boundaries**
The boundary of a well’s gradient basin expands outward as a compatibility wavefront.  
This wavefront is not emitted or transmitted; it is the dynamic shape of the well’s influence.

## **6.5 Temporal Reinterpretation**
As wells strengthen or weaken, the gamma field reinterprets past ticks.  
Entities adjust their internal models accordingly, linking well propagation to temporal coherence.

## **6.6 Stability Condition**
A well remains stable when:

\[
\text{Propagation Rate} \ge \text{Decay Rate}
\]

If propagation dominates, the well becomes a persistent attractor.  
If decay dominates, the well dissolves.

# **7. Semantic Reconstruction**

## **7.1 Re‑Interpreter Principle**
One or a small number of entities perform temporal coherence reconstruction.  
These entities reinterpret the entire past based on the current gamma field, ensuring global consistency across ticks.

## **7.2 Retrodictive Coherence**
The gamma field encodes accumulated structure.  
Entities reconstruct the past not by remembering it, but by inferring what it must have been to produce the present field.

---

# **8. Summary**
In a tick‑frame universe, waves, wells, attractors, and entity dynamics arise naturally from the evolution of the gamma field.  
Waves require no explicit propagation mechanism; they are the expansion of compatibility gradients.  
Entities survive by following these gradients, orbiting attractors, and maintaining temporal coherence.  
The resulting system forms a self‑consistent ontology where existence, learning, and navigation are emergent properties of the field’s evolution.
