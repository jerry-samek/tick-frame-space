# Black Holes in the Tick–Frame Model

## 🕳️ Substrate Layer (Tick-Level Reality)

- Mass concentrated in a small spatial region → tick consumption per Planck cell grows.
- At a threshold, the tick budget required for outward propagation exceeds the causal limit.
- Result: updates inside continue, but cannot escape → **event horizon**.

---

## 👁️ Visualization Layer (Frame-Level Perception)

- To external observers:
    - **Infinite energy cost** to escape (\(\gamma \to \infty\)).
    - **Time dilation**: clocks appear frozen at the horizon.
    - **Length contraction**: collapsing region appears compressed.
- These are perceptual artifacts of frame aggregation, not substrate failure.

## 📐 Discrete Horizon Condition

- Horizon occurs when:
  \[
  \text{Ticks required to escape} > \text{Ticks available per frame}
  \]
- Equivalent to escape velocity exceeding causal limit:
  \[
  v_{\text{escape}} \ge c
  \]

## 🌌 Growth

- Substrate continues updating inside horizon.
- New mass falling in adds to tick budget → black hole grows.
- Visualization cannot render this growth outward, but the causal engine processes it internally.

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Black holes = regions where causality is trapped inside, and the rendering engine cannot project updates outward.**
- Substrate remains finite and consistent, but visualization shows infinities.
- Growth continues because the underlying tick engine never stops — it just becomes hidden beyond the horizon.
