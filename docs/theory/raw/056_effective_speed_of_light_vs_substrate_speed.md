# Effective Speed of Light vs. Substrate Speed
### Why the Measured Speed of Light Is Slower Than the Tick‑Frame Limit

## 1. Substrate Speed \(c\) vs. Pattern Speed

In the tick‑frame universe, the fundamental constant \(c\) is:

\[
c = \text{maximum displacement of a pattern per tick}
\]

This is the **substrate limit**—the fastest anything can move if it takes a perfectly straight, uninterrupted step every tick.

But real physical entities (like photons) are not substrate‑level “pure steps.”  
They are **patterns**, and patterns have structure.

This distinction is crucial:

- **substrate c** = geometric limit of the underlying grid
- **measured speed of light** = effective speed of a structured, oscillating pattern

These two are not the same.

## 2. Why a Pattern Cannot Reach Substrate \(c\)

To reach the substrate limit, a pattern must:

- move exactly one cell per tick
- never deviate sideways
- never oscillate
- never interact
- never excite
- never scatter
- never lose a tick to internal dynamics

In other words:

> **Only a perfectly straight, interaction‑free trajectory reaches c.**

Any deviation reduces the *projected* velocity in the direction of travel.

## 3. Oscillation = Slower Effective Speed

A wave pattern (like a photon) has:

- internal oscillation
- lateral motion components
- periodic energy redistribution
- interactions with the γ‑field
- a non‑zero “width” in the substrate

This means that each tick includes:

- some forward motion
- some sideways motion
- some internal update steps

So the **effective forward displacement per tick** is:

\[
v_{\text{eff}} = c \cdot \cos(\theta_{\text{local}})
\]

where \(\theta_{\text{local}}\) is the instantaneous deviation from a perfect straight‑line step.

Thus:

> **Waves are slower than the substrate limit because they wiggle.**

## 4. Real‑World Interpretation

In physics:

- Light in vacuum travels at \(c\).
- Light in matter travels slower.
- Massive particles always travel slower than light.
- Wave packets disperse.
- Interactions cause delays.

Tick‑frame interpretation:

- Vacuum photons are the closest thing to a straight‑line pattern.
- Matter introduces scattering → effective speed drops.
- Massive particles have internal structure → even more deviation → lower speed.

So the measured “speed of light” is:

\[
v_{\text{light}} = \text{effective speed of a structured oscillating pattern}
\]

not the substrate limit.

## 5. The Key Insight

### **The physical speed of light is not the true c.
It is the speed of a wave pattern that cannot move perfectly straight.**

The substrate limit \(c\) is higher.  
The measured speed of light is the **projection** of a wiggling pattern onto a straight line.

This explains:

- why light slows down in media
- why massive particles never reach c
- why dispersion exists
- why wave packets spread
- why “speed of light” is an emergent property, not a fundamental one

---

## 6. Summary

- Substrate \(c\) = maximum causal step per tick
- Real photons = oscillating patterns
- Oscillation introduces sideways motion
- Sideways motion reduces forward projection
- Therefore measured speed < substrate speed
- Our “speed of light” is an emergent, effective value

In short:

> **Light is slower than c because it wiggles.**
