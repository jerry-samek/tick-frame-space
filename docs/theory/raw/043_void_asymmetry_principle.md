# Void Asymmetry Principle

## Definition

Presence - Anti-Presence asymmetry arises not from imbalance between **1 (Presence)** and **−1 (Anti‑Presence)** alone,
but from the stabilizing role of **0 (Void)**. The void absorbs annihilation events, preventing perfect cancellation and
leaving a surplus of presence.

---

## Trinary States

- **1 = Presence (matter)**
- **−1 = Anti‑Presence (antimatter)**
- **0 = Void (buffer/stabilizer)**

---

## Collision Dynamics

- `1 + (-1) → 0` (annihilation absorbed into void)
- `1 + 1 → 1` (presence reinforces itself)
- `(-1) + (-1) → -1` (anti‑presence reinforces itself)
- `0 + 1 → 1` (void allows presence to persist)
- `0 + (-1) → -1` (void allows anti‑presence to persist)
- `0 + 0 → 0` (void remains void)

---

## Operator Bias

- **NAND:** Seeds alternation and void islands.
- **OR:** Favors presence (1), stabilizing surplus.
- **XOR:** Amplifies difference, producing bursts of −1.
- **AND:** Compresses entropy, increasing frequency of 0.

## Phase Flips

- At operator boundaries, phase flips ensure −1 appears regularly.
- Void (0) absorbs imbalance, preventing perfect symmetry.

---

## Emergent Asymmetry

- Symmetric rules still yield asymmetric outcomes.
- Presence (1) dominates over time.
- Void (0) acts as a reservoir, breaking perfect cancellation.
- Explains why matter persisted after the Big Bang.

Anti-Presence (-1) ------------/

Void (0) -----------------------> absorbs imbalance

Operators:
- NAND: seeds alternation, creates 0 islands
- OR: stabilizes 1 (presence surplus)
- XOR: injects -1 bursts
- AND: compresses into 0

Phase flips: ensure -1 appears, but 0 absorbs excess
Result: Surplus of 1 (matter) emerges from symmetric rules
