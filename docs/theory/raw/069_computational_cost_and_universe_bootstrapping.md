# Addendum: Computational Cost and Universe Bootstrapping

A quick clarification: **the computational cost required to *start* a tick‑frame universe is not necessarily extreme.**  
The earlier estimates describe the cost of simulating a *fully resolved Planck‑granular observer*, not the cost of initiating the substrate itself.

In practice, **bootstrapping the process requires only modest computational resources**, because:

- the substrate can begin at very low resolution,
- complexity emerges gradually as the system evolves,
- and the entire architecture is inherently **scalable**.

As computational power increases, the simulation can support:

- higher spatial and temporal granularity,
- richer entity dynamics,
- deeper historical buffers,
- and more detailed visualization layers.

In other words: **a universe can begin on a laptop and grow with the hardware**, because the substrate does not require full Planck‑scale fidelity at initialization.
