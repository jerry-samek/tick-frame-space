# Imbalance Theory in Tick‑Frame Universe

---

## Abstract

Imbalance in the tick‑frame universe is not accidental but structurally inevitable. Beginning from a single cell (1×1×1
grid), the system must expand to larger horizons (2×2×2, 3×3×3, …). This expansion forces dilution of energy and parity
constraints that cannot be perfectly satisfied. As a result, persistence (matter‑like) and collapse (antimatter‑like)
emerge immediately and continue at every tick. Energy is not a conserved initial quantity but a function of time,
defined by renewal across expanding grids.

---

## 1. Initial Condition

- At \(t=0\), the universe consists of a single entity in a 1×1×1 grid.
- Energy density is 100% across the whole grid.
- No stored reservoir of energy exists; persistence begins from one.

---

## 2. First Expansion

- At \(t=1\), the horizon buffer requires a 2×2×2 grid (8 cells).
- The single entity must replicate or distribute itself across the expanded horizon.
- Perfect symmetry is impossible, leading to immediate imbalance.
- Energy across the whole expanded grid is **less than 100%**.

---

## 3. Consequence

- **Matter analogue:** Cells that successfully renew persistence across ticks.
- **Antimatter analogue:** Cells that fail renewal, collapsing at the horizon.
- **Energy:** Emerges as a temporal function of persistence, not as a conserved initial store.

---

## 4. Formalization

Let:

- \(N_t\) = number of cells at tick \(t\)
- \(P_t\) = number of persistent entities at tick \(t\)

Then:
\[
N_0 = 1, \quad N_1 = 8
\]

Persistence condition:
\[
P_{t+1} \leq N_{t+1}, \quad P_{t+1} = f(P_t, \gamma, H)
\]

Because \(P_0 = 1\) but \(N_1 = 8\), imbalance occurs immediately:
\[
P_1 < N_1
\]

Global dilution constraint:
\[
\sum_{x \in \mathcal{G}_{t+1}} E_{t+1}(x) \;<\; \sum_{x \in \mathcal{G}_{t}} E_{t}(x)
\]

---

## 5. Parity Constraint: Imbalance at Every Expansion

- Expansion forces entities to map onto new coordinates.
- Coordinates are divided into **odd** and **even** indices along each axis.
- Persistence requires alignment with renewal cycles, but entities cannot simultaneously satisfy both odd and even
  parity.
- Therefore imbalance is guaranteed at every tick, not only the first.

Formal statement:
\[
P_t < N_t \quad \text{for all } t > 0
\]

## 6. Visualization: Energy Distribution Across Expansion

### Step 0 — Initial Cube

[█] Energy: 100% across the whole 1×1×1 universe grid

### Step 1 — Expanded Horizon

[█][ ] ][ ] [ ][ ] ][ ] [ ][ ] ][ ] [ ][ ] ][ ] Energy: less than 100% across the whole 2×2×2 universe grid

### Observer’s Perspective

- **t=0:** Infinite density → 100% energy in one cube.
- **t=1:** Expansion → energy diluted across multiple cubes, total < 100%.
- **Imbalance:** Some cubes persist (matter‑like), others collapse (antimatter‑like).

## 7. Scientific Comparison

- **Matter–antimatter asymmetry:**
    - Science: Puzzle explained by CP violation in particle physics.
    - Tick‑frame: Structural necessity of expansion and parity constraints.
- **Energy distribution:**
    - Science: All energy present at the Big Bang, redistributed as a universe expands.
    - Tick‑frame: Energy emerges as a function of time, always less than 100% after expansion.
- **Implication:**
    - Science treats imbalance as an anomaly.
    - Tick‑frame treats imbalance as inevitable geometry.

---

## 8. Implications

- **Existence:** Defined by renewal across expanding horizons.
- **Imbalance:** Permanent structural feature of discrete expansion.
- **Framework:** Reframes cosmological asymmetry as a built‑in property of lattice growth.
- **Energy:** Temporal invariant, not a conserved initial store.

## Note on Edge Generation and Speculation

Even if energy were generated at the **edges of the cube space** during tick time, imbalance would still persist.

- Edge cells differ structurally from interior cells (fewer neighbors, different causal cones).
- Odd/even parity constraints remain unsatisfied.
- Therefore imbalance is enforced by geometry itself, not by the location of energy generation.

**Speculation:** This remains a speculative construct. We do not yet have any defined mechanism for **matter emergence**
in the tick‑frame model. The imbalance principle should be treated as a structural hypothesis until emergence rules are
specified.
