# RAW 104 — Emission–Recoil Duality of Wells and Hills

## Overview

RAW 104 formalizes the geometric and energetic distinction between gravity‑well and gravity‑hill environments, focusing
on how radiative emission interacts with curvature and how recoil determines the direction of motion. This principle
explains why braking radiation is visible and meaningful on a hill, while it becomes trapped and self‑reinforcing in a
well.

## Statement of the Principle

Entities undergoing deceleration in a curved potential must emit radiation. The direction and effect of this emission
depend entirely on the sign of the curvature:

- In **well‑geometries**, outward emission produces inward recoil, pushing the entity deeper into the well and trapping
  the emitted radiation.

- In **hill‑geometries**, outward emission produces uphill recoil, slowing the descent and allowing the radiation to
  escape and become observable.

## Key Consequences

### 1. Emission Reinforces Descent in Wells

- Radiation emitted outward from a well is redshifted and gravitationally trapped.
- The recoil from emission reduces the entity's total energy and increases inward momentum.
- The bottom of the well becomes a radiation sink with no outward communication.

### 2. Emission Brakes Descent on Hills

- Radiation emitted outward from a hill propagates freely and is not trapped.
- Recoil pushes the entity uphill, acting as a natural braking mechanism.
- The hill becomes a transparent amplifier of descent dynamics.

### 3. Visibility vs. Silence

- **Wells** hide their dynamics: emission is swallowed, redshifted, or lost.
- **Hills** reveal their dynamics: emission escapes and encodes curvature information.

## Formal Expression

Let $E$ be an entity with momentum $p$ moving along a curvature-defined potential. Let $\Delta p_{\text{emit}}$ be the
recoil from radiative emission.

**Well geometry** (negative curvature):
$$\Delta p_{\text{recoil}} < 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_{\text{final}} = p + \Delta p_{\text{recoil}} \text{ pushes deeper into the well}$$

**Hill geometry** (positive curvature):
$$\Delta p_{\text{recoil}} > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad p_{\text{final}} = p + \Delta p_{\text{recoil}} \text{ brakes descent}$$

The sign of curvature determines the sign of recoil.

## Interpretive Notes

- Emission is not merely energy loss; it is **directional negotiation with geometry**.
- **Wells** act as sinks: they silence emission and accelerate descent.
- **Hills** act as sources: they broadcast emission and slow descent.
- This duality explains why Bremsstrahlung-like effects are visible on hills but suppressed in wells.

## Implications for Gamma-Hill Universes

- Entities descending the gamma hill naturally emit uphill-directed radiation.
- This radiation is observable and encodes the slope and curvature of the hill.
- Downward emission would violate geometric consistency by pushing entities further downhill.

## Summary

RAW 104 establishes that radiative emission interacts with curvature to determine a recoil direction. In wells, emission
deepens descent and becomes trapped; in hills, emission brakes descent and becomes visible. This duality is fundamental
to understanding motion, energy exchange, and observability in curved potentials.
