# Defining Distance via Planck Units

## 1. Fundamental Units

- **Planck length (ℓₚ)**: smallest spatial step  
  \[
  \ell_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} \approx 1.616 \times 10^{-35}\,\text{m}
  \]

- **Planck time (tₚ)**: smallest temporal tick  
  \[
  t_P = \frac{\ell_P}{c} \approx 5.39 \times 10^{-44}\,\text{s}
  \]

## 2. Distance as Planck Steps

- A coordinate (x, y) in a 2D grid represents **how many Planck lengths** have been traversed along each axis.
- Example: Position (1,1) means:
    - 1 ℓₚ in x
    - 1 ℓₚ in y
- The **path length** is the number of ℓₚ units between origin and target.

## 3. Movement as Planck Ticks

- To move one ℓₚ requires at least one tₚ if traveling at speed c.
- Slower speeds mean more tₚ ticks per ℓₚ step.
- Thus, **distance is inseparable from time**: it is defined by the number of Planck ticks required to traverse.

## 4. Unified Definition

> **Distance = Number of Planck lengths traversed, interpreted through the Planck ticks required to reach that position.
**

So:

- **Space** = grid of Planck cells
- **Time** = counter of Planck ticks
- **Movement** = stepping through cells per tick

## 5. Example

- Origin: (0,0)
- Target: (3,4)
- Path length: 5 ℓₚ (Pythagoras)
- Minimum time: 5 tₚ (if moving at c)
- Actual time: >5 tₚ if moving slower
