# **RAW 084 — Subcritical Gamma Wells and Fragment Emission**
*Formal Ontological Document (Markdown Version)*

## **0. Context**
RAW 084 formalizes the nature of fragments emitted by an entity when regulating its internal energy.  
Fragments are not “failed entities”; they are **valid processes** with gamma wells whose parameters place them **below the stability threshold** required for self‑maintenance.  
Their fate depends entirely on environmental interaction (absorption, dispersion, interference).

RAW 084 extends RAW 083 (Entity as a Self‑Maintained Gamma Well) by describing how entities shed curvature without spawning new autonomous processes.

## **1. Definition of a Fragment**
A **fragment** is a transient process characterized by:

1. a **subcritical gamma well**,
2. minimal or zero lag,
3. insufficient energy to sustain self‑maintenance,
4. propagation at the maximum field speed,
5. rapid dissipation into the residual field unless absorbed.

Fragments are **ontologically valid patterns**, but not stable attractors.

---

## **2. Subcritical Gamma Well**
Every fragment carries a gamma well because:

- it has energy,
- it interacts with the field,
- and it must remain compatible with the gamma metric.

However, its well depth satisfies:

\[
W_{\text{fragment}} < W_{\text{crit}}
\]

where:

- \( W_{\text{crit}} \) is the minimum well depth required for a self‑maintaining entity,
- \( W_{\text{fragment}} \) is the curvature associated with the fragment.

This inequality guarantees that fragments **cannot** evolve into autonomous entities.

---

## **3. Origin of Fragments**
Fragments are emitted when an entity experiences **excess internal energy**:

- high lag,
- rapid expansion of the field,
- or sudden changes in rotation.

To prevent runaway growth or collapse, the entity:

1. reduces its lag,
2. ejects a portion of curvature and energy,
3. shapes it into a subcritical well,
4. and releases it into the field.

This mechanism preserves the entity’s stability while maintaining compatibility with the gamma field.

## **4. Fragment Dynamics**
Fragments exhibit the following behaviors:

### **4.1 Propagation**
- Move at the maximum propagation speed of the field.
- Follow radial or toroidal trajectories depending on emission mode.

### **4.2 Dissipation**
- Their subcritical well cannot sustain itself.
- They dissolve into the residual field over time.

### **4.3 Interaction**
Fragments may:

- be absorbed by residual,
- interfere with other fragments,
- or be absorbed by an entity’s gamma well.

Absorption transfers energy but does not create new entities.

---

## **5. Fragment Types**
Three primary regimes emerge:

### **5.1 Radial Fragment**
- Produced by sudden lag reduction.
- Carries outward momentum.
- Represents a direct release of excess curvature.

### **5.2 Torsional Fragment**
- Produced by abrupt changes in rotation or phase.
- Propagates as a twisted excitation.
- Transfers angular information.

### **5.3 Diffusive Fragment**
- Low‑energy, broad, and short‑lived.
- Increases local residual noise.
- Represents thermal dissipation.

These are not different “species,” but different **modes** of the same underlying process.

---

## **6. Stability Threshold**
A process becomes a self‑maintaining entity only if:

\[
W \ge W_{\text{crit}} \quad \text{and} \quad L > 0
\]

Fragments fail one or both conditions:

- insufficient well depth,
- insufficient lag,
- insufficient energy budget.

Thus, they remain transient.

---

## **7. Interpretation**
Fragments are:

- **legitimate processes**,
- **fully described by the same ontology**,
- but operating in a **non‑autonomous regime**.

They are analogous to:

- photons in physical systems,
- dissipative waves,
- or transient excitations.

Their existence is essential for:

- entity stability,
- energy regulation,
- and maintaining global coherence of the gamma field.

---

## **8. Summary**
RAW 084 establishes that:

- fragments are subcritical gamma wells,
- emitted intentionally by entities to regulate curvature,
- incapable of forming stable processes,
- and fully compatible with the gamma field.

They are not “failed entities,” but **transient patterns** whose behavior depends on environmental context.
