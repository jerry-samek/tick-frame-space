# Planck Cube Ledger Principle

**Definition**
In the tick‑frame universe, one tick corresponds to the Planck time

\[
t_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^5}} \approx 5.39 \times 10^{-44}\,\text{s}.
\]

Each spatial cell is a Planck cube of volume

\[
l_P^3 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}\right)^3 \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-105}\,\text{m}^3.
\]

The maximum ledger entry for a cell is “1,” representing the Planck energy contained within a single cube.

## Scientific Foundations

- **Planck energy:**

\[
E_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^5}{G}} \approx 1.96 \times 10^9\,\text{J}.
\]

- **Planck energy density:**

\[
\rho_P = \frac{E_P}{l_P^3} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{113}\,\text{J/m}^3.
\]

- **Ledger invariant:**
  Each tick checks that no cell exceeds “1” Planck cube’s worth of energy.
  Overflow marks the **horizon of representation**: entities collapse or saturate when attempting to exceed this bound.

## Engineering Echo

- **Tick cadence:** The universe advances one Planck time per tick.
- **Capacity rule:** Each cell can hold at most one Planck cube’s energy.
- **Overflow horizon:** Attempts to exceed this bound trigger extinction or saturation, depending on model choice.
- **Audit routine:** Log per‑cell energy; assert

\[
E_{\text{cell}} \leq E_P
\]

for all cells each tick.

## Philosophical Implication

Time itself is defined by the faintest unit of persistence the substrate can carry.
The **age of the tick‑frame universe** is the inverse of its minimal energy horizon: existence is measured by how gently
reality can move without breaking the Planck ledger.
