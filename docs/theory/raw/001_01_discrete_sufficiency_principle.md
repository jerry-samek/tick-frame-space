## Discrete Sufficiency Principle

*A model is sufficient if it can express all meaningful dynamics using only discrete, auditable quantities — without
requiring continuous mathematics, floating-point approximations, or infinite constructs.*

---

### Statement

The tick‑frame universe requires no calculus, no integrals, and no continuous functions to express motion, energy,
decay, or emergence.  
All meaningful dynamics are encoded through **natural numbers**, **sums**, and **comparisons**.

---

### Explanation

In this framework:

- **Time** = tick count
- **Space** = Planck steps
- **Energy** = tick duration
- **Velocity** = steps per tick
- **Mass** = tick budget per tick
- **Decay** = contextual shrinkage of tick significance
- **Relativity** = mismatch between tick and frame aggregation
- **Gravity** = tick exhaustion
- **Free will** = bounded tick allocation
- **Genesis** = first tick, not infinite compression
- **Black holes** = tick saturation zones
- **Expansion** = sliding horizon buffer
- **Observation** = reading embedded tick artefacts

None of these require:

- floating-point math
- continuous curves
- infinite series
- differential equations

Instead, they emerge from **pure counting**.

### Implications

- **Auditability:** Every quantity is countable, falsifiable, and reproducible.
- **Stability:** No rounding errors, no drift, no divergence.
- **Elegance:** Complexity arises from simple rules, not mathematical machinery.
- **Universality:** The same principles apply across physics, biology, and consciousness.
- **Computability:** The entire universe can be simulated with integer-safe logic.
- **Philosophical depth:** Infinity is removed not by denial, but by sufficiency.

### Example

Consider velocity:

- Continuous physics:  
  \[
  v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
  \]

- Tick-frame physics:  
  \[
  v = \frac{n_{\text{steps}}}{n_{\text{ticks}}}
  \]

Same concept.  
But now it’s **integer-based**, **bounded**, and **auditable**.

Or consider decay:

- Continuous physics:  
  \[
  E(t) = E_0 e^{-t/\tau}
  \]

- Tick-frame physics:  
  \[
  E = o - b,\quad \text{significance} \propto \frac{E}{U}
  \]

No exponentials.  
Just contextual comparison of two natural numbers.

---

### Summary

The **Discrete Sufficiency Principle** asserts that all meaningful dynamics in the tick‑frame universe can be expressed
using only natural numbers, sums, and comparisons.  
This makes the model falsifiable, computable, and philosophically coherent — a universe built not on abstraction, but on
**counting**.
