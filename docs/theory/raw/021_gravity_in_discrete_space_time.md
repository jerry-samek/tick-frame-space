# Gravity in Discrete Space–Time

*(Extended with Sampling‑Collapse Relativity)*

---

## 🌌 Core Principle

> **Gravity emerges when local sampling frequency collapses due to excessive tick demand.**  
> **Mass does not create gravity — mass creates time‑flow gradients, and gravity is the consequence.**

In this model, gravity is not a force and not a curvature of a geometric manifold.  
It is the emergent behavior that appears when **observer time slows relative to substrate time** because the tick budget
of a region becomes saturated.

The substrate remains perfectly consistent.  
The visualization layer interprets **time‑flow gradients** as curvature, attraction, and horizons.

---

## 🪨 Mass and Tick Budget

- Each object with mass \(m_i\) consumes a tick budget \(T_i\) per Planck tick.
- More massive or complex objects require more causal updates.
- Regional tick demand:

\[
T_{\text{region}} = \sum_i T_i
\]

When \(T_{\text{region}}\) approaches or exceeds the observer’s sampling capacity, **local time slows**.

This slowdown *is* gravity.

---

## 🧠 Substrate Layer (Proper Time)

- The substrate advances one tick at a time, uniformly and deterministically.
- No infinities, no singularities, no breakdowns.
- Gravity does **not** exist here.
- What we call “gravity” is encoded as **tick‑pressure gradients** — differences in computational load per region.

The substrate never curves, never slows, never collapses.  
Only **observers** do.

---

## 👁️ Visualization Layer (Observer Time)

Observers cannot process every tick when tick demand is high.  
This produces:

- **Time dilation**: fewer ticks processed → slower local time
- **Spatial curvature**: paths bend toward slow‑time regions
- **Gravitational lensing**: light appears to curve due to sampling collapse
- **Redshift**: fewer samples per tick → lower observed frequency

These are **perceptual artifacts** of sampling collapse, not substrate physics.

---

## ⏱️ Gravity as Time‑Flow Gradient

This is the key insight:

> **Gravity is caused by relativity (observer‑dependent time flow), not the other way around.**

Mass increases tick demand → sampling frequency drops → local time slows.

Particles moving through this gradient:

- experience fewer updates per substrate tick
- cannot “escape” into faster‑time regions
- follow paths of least tick resistance
- appear to accelerate toward mass

Nothing pulls them.  
They simply propagate through a landscape where **time flows unevenly**.

This is the discrete analogue of geodesics.

---

## 📐 Horizon Formation

A horizon forms when:

\[
T_{\text{escape}} > F_{\text{frame budget}}
\]

Meaning:

- escaping the region would require more updates than the observer can process
- the effective speed of light collapses to zero
- outward propagation becomes unrenderable

Equivalent condition:

\[
v_{\text{escape}} \ge c
\]

The horizon is not a physical boundary — it is a **sampling boundary**.

Inside it, the substrate continues updating normally.  
Outside it, observers cannot keep up.

---

## 🧲 Gravity as Tick Pressure

Mass creates **tick pressure**:

- high pressure → slow observer time
- low pressure → fast observer time

Objects naturally follow **tick‑pressure gradients**, which appear as:

- curved paths
- acceleration toward mass
- stable orbits
- gravitational wells

This is the discrete analogue of “curved spacetime,” but without geometry or infinities.

---

## 🌱 Growth and Dynamics

- Black holes grow as new mass increases tick demand inside the horizon.
- The substrate continues updating internally at full speed.
- Observers outside cannot render these updates, but the causal engine processes them.
- No singularities form — only **sampling collapse**.

---

## ♾️ No Infinities, No Singularities

Classical gravity predicts:

- infinite curvature
- infinite density
- infinite time dilation

In this model:

- tick demand increases
- sampling frequency decreases
- time‑flow collapses toward zero
- horizons form when sampling reaches zero

Nothing diverges.  
Everything remains finite and computable.

This is gravity consistent with the **Infinity Removal Principle**.

---

## ✅ Summary

> **Gravity is a time‑flow gradient caused by tick‑budget saturation.**  
> **Mass slows observer time by increasing tick demand.**  
> **Objects follow paths of least tick resistance, not forces.**  
> **Horizon formation is sampling collapse, not singularity.**  
> **The substrate remains perfectly causal and finite.**

Gravity is not a force.  
Gravity is not curvature.  
Gravity is **emergent relativity** in a discrete tick‑frame universe.

### Tick vs observer time (time dilation via sampling collapse)

Proper time (substrate ticks)
-----------------------------

substrate ticks:   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Observer A (far from mass)
--------------------------

sampling:          X X X X X X X X X X X X X
^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
ticks seen:        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12

=> τ_observer(A) ≈ τ_proper  (no dilation: γ_eff ≈ 1.0)


Observer B (near mass, high tick pressure)
------------------------------------------

sampling:          X X X X X
^ ^ ^ ^ ^
ticks seen:        0 2 4 6 9

missed ticks:          1 3 5 7 8 10 11 12 ...

=> τ_observer(B) < τ_proper  (time runs slower: γ_eff < 1.0)

Interpretation:

- Same substrate ticks for everyone.
- Observer A keeps up: sees every tick.
- Observer B lags: sees only a subset of ticks → local time dilation.

### Tick‑pressure “gravity well” (time‑flow gradient)

Tick pressure landscape (1D cross-section)
------------------------------------------

low pressure medium high pressure
fast time flow slower time very slow time
(far)                (near)                 (core)
τ ≈ 1.0 τ < 1.0 τ → 0

             *-------------------------*
            (orbit / trapped region)

Intuition:

- Higher tick pressure = slower observer time.
- Objects follow paths of least tick resistance → they “fall” into the well.
- No force; just propagation through a time‑flow gradient.

                         /       \______/    |                      |

Legend:

- region A: observer samples almost every tick (normal time).
- region B: sampling noticeably sparser (time dilation).
- HORIZON: minimal sampling; outward propagation no longer renderable.
- region C: substrate still updates, but observer sees almost nothing.

Escape condition:

    T_escape > F_frame_budget    →  horizon forms
    v_escape ≥ c                 →  escape is unrenderable

So:

- Substrate *inside* keeps ticking.
- From outside, updates from C cannot cross the horizon in finite sampled time.
- The horizon is a **sampling boundary**, not a physical edge.
