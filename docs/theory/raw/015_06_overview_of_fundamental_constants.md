# Overview of Fundamental Constants

### *A reference list for drift analysis in the tick‑frame model*

This document summarizes the major physical and mathematical constants that can be reinterpreted within the tick‑frame
framework as **emergent**, **scale‑dependent**, or **observer‑dependent** quantities.

Each entry includes:

- **Category**
- **Classical meaning**
- **Why it is not fundamental in a tick‑frame universe**
- **Expected drift behavior**

# 1. Physical Constants

## 1.1 Speed of Light — \(c\)

**Classical meaning:** Maximum speed of causal influence.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Emerges from the maximum step‑per‑tick propagation.
- Not a stored constant; a limit of the update rule.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Stable locally, but may shift with horizon scale or reconstruction metric.

---

## 1.2 Planck Constant — \(h\)

**Classical meaning:** Quantum of action.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Quantization arises from discrete ticks, not from \(h\).
- \(h\) is a reconstruction parameter linking discrete action to continuous models.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Slow drift with horizon and resolution.

---

## 1.3 Gravitational Constant — \(G\)

**Classical meaning:** Strength of gravity.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Gravity is curvature of reconstructed causal structure.
- \(G\) is an emergent scaling factor, not a substrate parameter.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Varies with density, horizon, and reconstruction geometry.

---

## 1.4 Cosmological Constant — \(\Lambda\)

**Classical meaning:** Rate of cosmic expansion.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Expansion is simply horizon growth in tick‑time.
- \(\Lambda\) is an observational artifact of embedding.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Strong drift; epoch‑dependent.

---

## 1.5 Fine‑Structure Constant — \(\alpha\)

\[
\alpha = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c}
\]

**Classical meaning:** Strength of electromagnetic interaction.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- A ratio of four emergent quantities, all driftable.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Composite drift; already hinted in astrophysical data.

---

## 1.6 Vacuum Permittivity — \(\epsilon_0\)

## 1.7 Vacuum Permeability — \(\mu_0\)

**Classical meaning:** Electromagnetic properties of vacuum.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- “Vacuum” is not a substrate entity.
- These constants arise from how fields are reconstructed.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Scale‑ and metric‑dependent.

---

## 1.8 Boltzmann Constant — \(k_B\)

**Classical meaning:** Converts temperature to energy.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Temperature and energy are statistical reconstructions.
- \(k_B\) is a conversion factor between emergent quantities.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Drift tied to statistical resolution.

---

## 1.9 Electron Charge — \(e\)

**Classical meaning:** Fundamental unit of electric charge.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Charge is an emergent label for interaction patterns.
- \(e\) is a stable reconstruction, not a substrate primitive.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Very slow drift; tied to \(\alpha\).

---

## 1.10 Particle Masses — \(m_e, m_p, m_n, ...\)

**Classical meaning:** Inertial and gravitational mass.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Mass is a reconstruction of interaction frequency and propagation resistance.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Possible slow drift with horizon and embedding.

---

# 2. Mathematical Constants

## 2.1 π (Pi)

**Classical meaning:** Ratio of circumference to diameter.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- In discrete space, π is scale‑dependent.
- Approaches the continuous value only asymptotically.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Drift with horizon and maximum realizable radius.

---

## 2.2 Euler’s Number — \(e\)

**Classical meaning:** Base of natural logarithms; continuous growth.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Exponential behavior is an approximation of discrete compounding.
- Effective “e” depends on discretization.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Drift with resolution of growth processes.

---

## 2.3 Golden Ratio — \(\phi\)

**Classical meaning:** Limit of Fibonacci ratios; appears in natural patterns.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Emergent from discrete recurrence relations.
- Sensitive to reconstruction rules.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Drift in systems with changing recurrence structure.

---

# 3. Geometric and Structural Constants

## 3.1 Dimensionality Constants

**Classical meaning:** Space has fixed dimension (3D).  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Dimension is an embedding choice by the observer.
- 3D is optimal for universe‑likeness, not substrate truth.  
  **Expected drift:**
- None at substrate level; possible shifts in reconstruction.

---

## 3.2 Curvature Constants

**Classical meaning:** Global curvature of spacetime.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Curvature is a reconstruction of causal adjacency.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Drift with horizon and density.

---

## 3.3 Scaling Exponents (critical exponents, fractal dimensions)

**Classical meaning:** Describe scaling near phase transitions.  
**Tick‑frame view:**

- Emergent from local update rules.  
  **Expected drift:**
- Drift with resolution and system size.

# ✅ Closing Note

This overview shows that **no classical constant remains fundamental** in the tick‑frame ontology.  
All constants are:

- emergent,
- scale‑dependent,
- horizon‑dependent,
- reconstruction‑dependent,
- and therefore driftable.

This list can be expanded as needed when new constants appear in later chapters.
