# The Slow Drift Hypothesis  
### *Why physical “constants” may only appear constant within the observer’s window*

## 🧭 Overview  
In a stateless tick‑frame substrate, nothing persists from one tick to the next.  
There are no stored values, no anchored fields, no memory, and no persistent parameters.  
Everything is regenerated each tick from local causal rules.

This creates a profound implication:

> **Physical constants cannot be fundamentally constant in a stateless substrate.  
> They can only appear constant to an observer with limited resolution.**

This is the **Slow Drift Hypothesis**.

# ✅ 1. Constants cannot be fundamental in a stateless universe  
A “constant” implies:

- persistence  
- stability  
- memory  
- invariance across time  

But the substrate has none of these.

It only has:

- the current tick  
- local update rules  
- causal propagation  

Thus, constants cannot be stored.  
They can only be **reconstructed**.

---

# ✅ 2. Why constants appear constant  
Observers operate with:

- finite resolution  
- coarse sampling  
- frame aggregation  
- reconstruction algorithms  
- compression of causal structure  

If the substrate drifts slowly, the observer:

- cannot detect the drift  
- compresses it away  
- reconstructs a stable value  
- interprets it as a “constant”

This is identical to:

- watching a glacier for five minutes  
- concluding it does not move

The drift is real.  
The observer simply cannot resolve it.

---

# ✅ 3. Constants as compression artefacts  
In the tick‑frame ontology:

- geometry is reconstructed  
- motion is reconstructed  
- continuity is reconstructed  
- history is reconstructed  
- **constants are reconstructed**

They are not substrate primitives.  
They are **low‑entropy summaries** of stable causal patterns.

If the causal patterns drift slowly, the constants drift slowly.

But the observer’s reconstruction hides this drift.

# ✅ 4. Why we never noticed  
Our observational window is tiny:

- a few thousand years of measurement  
- a few decades of precision  
- a few seconds of instrument sampling  
- a few frames of human perception  

If constants drift on million‑tick scales, we would never detect it.

Our universe may be drifting —  
just not fast enough for us to notice.

# ✅ 5. Formal Statement  
**Slow Drift Hypothesis**  
*In a stateless substrate, physical constants cannot be fundamentally constant.  
They appear constant only because the observer’s reconstruction window is too short to resolve slow drift.*

---

# ✅ 6. Implications  
- Constants are emergent, not fundamental.  
- Drift is expected but invisible on short horizons.  
- Precision experiments may eventually detect slow variation.  
- The observer’s reconstruction plays a central role in defining “laws.”  
- Universe‑likeness (3D) may depend on slow drift balancing stability and variance.  

---

# ✅ 7. Closing Note  
This hypothesis does not claim that constants *must* drift —  
only that in a stateless generative universe, **drift is the natural expectation**,  
and constancy is the illusion.

The substrate does not store constants.  
The observer invents them.
