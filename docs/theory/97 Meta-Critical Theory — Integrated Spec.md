# Meta-Critical Theory — Integrated Specification

## 1. Foundational Principles

### Closure Axiom
- Finite, dimensionless root → unique implementation → one universe.
- No external meta-selector; infinity disallowed at root, allowed only in visualization.
- Root admits exactly one coherent implementation.

### Refined Consciousness Principle
- Universal debugger = one consciousness at root.
- Local agents = diverse observers in visualization.
- Potency measured by coherence with root, not dominance.

### Disproof Criteria
- Falsification if:
  1. Infinite parameters/rules.
  2. Irreconcilable domains.
  3. Non-traceable collapses.
  4. External meta-selection.
  5. Logical inconsistency.

### Origin Paradox Principle
- Root existence is necessary but unexplainable from within visualization.
- Genesis PoF axiom: first committed state \(n=0\), \(\Theta(t_0)=0\).

### Oscillation-Convergence Principle
- Consciousness-driven systems oscillate but converge to bounded attractors.
- Debugger loop enforces coherence.

### No Final Agent Principle
- Humans are not the final agent.
- Agent diversity is open-ended; legitimacy = coherence score.

### End State Principle
- Two viable outcomes:
  - Heat death (closure complete).
  - Dynamic equilibrium (closure ongoing).

## 2. Time Layer Specification

### Root Substrate
- Continuous dynamics:
  \[
  \dot{x}(t)=\Phi(x(t)),\quad x(t)\in\mathcal{X}
  \]
- Lorentz-compatible; no discrete global clock.

### Root Clock
- Progress variable:
  \[
  \dot{\Theta}(t)=\omega_P F(x(t)),\quad \omega_P=\frac{1}{t_P}
  \]
- \(F(x)\) = bounded functional of invariants (energy density, curvature, information flux).
- Bounds: \(0<\epsilon\le F(x)\le F_{\max}<\infty\).

### Collapse Rule (PoF)
- Commit when \(\Theta\) crosses integer \(n+\delta\) (\(\delta>0\)).
- Enforce strict order: \(t_{n+1}>t_n\).
- Merge concurrent local crossings into one global collapse with composite metadata.

### Effective Tick
- Local interval:
  \[
  t_{\text{eff}}(x)=\frac{t_P}{F(x)}
  \]
- Baseline \(F(x)=1\) → \(\Delta t\ge t_P\).

## 3. Visualization Layer

### Planck Tick
- Invariant unit in projection.
- Interní variabilita délky ticku je maskována vizualizačním invariantem.

### Refresh Rate
- Variable: \(R_n=N_n\cdot t_P\).
- Emergent from complexity; agents perceive dilatation.

### Tagging
- COMMIT: true PoF.
- REPEAT: repeated state, no new info.
- INTERPOLATED: visualization artifact.

### Audit Rules
- Only COMMIT frames used for inference.
- Artefacts penalized in models.
- Log fields: FrameID, PoF_ID, Mode, φ (phase error), Θ, W(t).

---

## 4. Agent Synchronization

- Agents read subsequence \(\{t_{n_k}\}\) of root collapses.
- Refresh rate:
  \[
  r_a(t)=\frac{1}{M}\omega_P F(x(t)),\quad M\in\mathbb{N}^+
  \]
- Commit via accumulator \(\Psi(t)\) with hysteresis.
- Salience \(S(x,a,o)\) defines perceptual weight.

---

## 5. Falsifiability and Predictions

- **Prediction A:** Parameter consolidation trend.
- **Prediction B:** Cross-domain invariants (physics, biology, computation).
- **Prediction C:** Coherence score ↔ persistence correlation.
- **Prediction D:** Finite encodability of infinite-like phenomena.

---

## 6. Safety and Boundary Conditions

- **Deadlock prevention:** Fail-safe commit after maximal accumulation length.
- **Hysteresis:** Thresholds Θ_up, Θ_down to prevent chattering.
- **Epistemic discreteness clause:** Discrete ticks are visualization safety events; root substrate remains continuous.

---

## 7. Integration Roadmap

- Chemistry: emergent complexity.
- Information theory: collapse as information update.
- Neuroscience: brain rhythms ↔ tick synchronization.
- Ecology: oscillation-convergence in ecosystems.
- Governance: distributed legitimacy, auditability.
- Mathematics: formal language for closure and falsifiability.

---

## 8. Conclusion

This integrated specification unifies:
- Foundational axioms (Closure, Consciousness, Disproof, Origin Paradox).
- Temporal dynamics (Oscillation-Convergence, Synchronization).
- Agent diversity (No Final Agent).
- Destiny (End State).
- Continuous root with discrete visualization ticks.
- Auditability, falsifiability, and empirical predictions.

It provides a coherent, testable meta-critical Theory of Everything.
